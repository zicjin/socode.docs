<h1>Experimental Support for ECMAScript Modules in Node.js</h1>
<div id="deprecated-content" class="deprecated"><div><p>The contents are about a work in progress topic.</p></div></div>
<blockquote> <p>Note: this functionality is currently experimental and prone to changing. It can currently only be used on <a href="nightly-builds">nightly builds</a> of TypeScript, and we are currently seeking feedback around bugs and pain-points.</p> </blockquote> <p>For the last few years, Node.js has been working to support running ECMAScript modules (ESM). This has been a very difficult feature to support, since the foundation of the Node.js ecosystem is built on a different module system called CommonJS (CJS). Interoperating between the two brings large challenges, with many new features to juggle; however, support for ESM in Node.js is now largely implemented in Node.js 12 and later, and the dust has begun to settle.</p> <p>That’s why TypeScript brings two new <code>module</code> and <code>moduleResolution</code> settings: <code>node12</code> and <code>nodenext</code>.</p> <pre data-language="json">{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "nodenext",
    }
}</pre> <p>These new modes bring a few high-level features which we’ll explore here.</p> <h3 id="type-in-packagejson-and-new-extensions" style="position:relative;">
<code>type</code> in <code>package.json</code> and New Extensions</h3> <p>Node.js supports <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_package_json_and_file_extensions">a new setting in <code>package.json</code></a> called <code>type</code>. <code>"type"</code> can be set to either <code>"module"</code> or <code>"commonjs"</code>.</p> <pre data-language="json">{
    "name": "my-package",
    "type": "module",

    "//": "...",
    "dependencies": {
    }
}</pre> <p>This setting controls whether <code>.js</code> files are interpreted as ES modules or CommonJS modules, and defaults to CommonJS when not set. When a file is considered an ES module, a few different rules come into play compared to CommonJS:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>import</code>/<code>export</code> statements (and top-level <code>await</code> in <code>nodenext</code>) can be used</li> <li>relative import paths need full extensions (we have to write <code>import "./foo.js"</code> instead of <code>import "./foo"</code>)</li> <li>imports might resolve differently from dependencies in <code>node_modules</code>
</li> <li>certain global-like values like <code>require()</code> and <code>process</code> cannot be used directly</li> <li>CommonJS modules get imported under certain special rules</li> </ul> <p>We’ll come back to some of these.</p> <p>To overlay the way TypeScript works in this system, <code>.ts</code> and <code>.tsx</code> files now work the same way. When TypeScript finds a <code>.ts</code>, <code>.tsx</code>, <code>.js</code>, or <code>.jsx</code> file, it will walk up looking for a <code>package.json</code> to see whether that file is an ES module, and use that to determine:</p> <ul> <li>how to find other modules which that file imports</li> <li>and how to transform that file if producing outputs</li> </ul> <p>When a <code>.ts</code> file is compiled as an ES module, ECMAScript <code>import</code>/<code>export</code> syntax is left alone in the <code>.js</code> output; when it’s compiled as a CommonJS module, it will produce the same output you get today under <code>--module commonjs</code>.</p> <p>This also means paths resolve differently between <code>.ts</code> files that are ES modules and ones that are CJS modules. For example, let’s say you have the following code today:</p> <pre data-language="ts">// ./foo.ts
export function helper() {
    // ...
}

// ./bar.ts
import { helper } from "./foo"; // only works in CJS

helper();</pre> <p>This code works in CommonJS modules, but will fail in ES modules because relative import paths need to use extensions. As a result, it will have to be rewritten to use the extension of the <em>output</em> of <code>foo.ts</code> - so <code>bar.ts</code> will instead have to import from <code>./foo.js</code>.</p> <pre data-language="ts">// ./bar.ts
import { helper } from "./foo.js"; // works in ESM &amp; CJS

helper();</pre> <p>This might feel a bit cumbersome at first, but TypeScript tooling like auto-imports and path completion will typically just do this for you.</p> <p>One other thing to mention is the fact that this applies to <code>.d.ts</code> files too. When TypeScript finds a <code>.d.ts</code> file in package, it is interpreted based on the containing package.</p> <h3 id="new-file-extensions" style="position:relative;">New File Extensions</h3> <p>The <code>type</code> field in <code>package.json</code> is nice because it allows us to continue using the <code>.ts</code> and <code>.js</code> file extensions which can be convenient; however, you will occasionally need to write a file that differs from what <code>type</code> specifies. You might also just prefer to always be explicit.</p> <p>Node.js supports two extensions to help with this: <code>.mjs</code> and <code>.cjs</code>. <code>.mjs</code> files are always ES modules, and <code>.cjs</code> files are always CommonJS modules, and there’s no way to override these.</p> <p>In turn, TypeScript supports two new source file extensions: <code>.mts</code> and <code>.cts</code>. When TypeScript emits these to JavaScript files, it will emit them to <code>.mjs</code> and <code>.cjs</code> respectively.</p> <p>Furthermore, TypeScript also supports two new declaration file extensions: <code>.d.mts</code> and <code>.d.cts</code>. When TypeScript generates declaration files for <code>.mts</code> and <code>.cts</code>, their corresponding extensions will be <code>.d.mts</code> and <code>.d.cts</code>.</p> <p>Using these extensions is entirely optional, but will often be useful even if you choose not to use them as part of your primary workflow.</p> <h3 id="commonjs-interop" style="position:relative;">CommonJS Interop</h3> <p>Node.js allows ES modules to import CommonJS modules as if they were ES modules with a default export.</p> <pre data-language="ts">// ./foo.cts
export function helper() {
    console.log("hello world!");
}

// ./bar.mts
import foo from "./foo.cjs";

// prints "hello world!"
foo.helper();</pre> <p>In some cases, Node.js also synthesizes named exports from CommonJS modules, which can be more convenient. In these cases, ES modules can use a “namespace-style” import (i.e. <code>import * as foo from "..."</code>), or named imports (i.e. <code>import { helper } from "..."</code>).</p> <pre data-language="ts">// ./foo.cts
export function helper() {
    console.log("hello world!");
}

// ./bar.mts
import { helper } from "./foo.cjs";

// prints "hello world!"
foo.helper();</pre> <p>There isn’t always a way for TypeScript to know whether these named imports will be synthesized, but TypeScript will err on being permissive and use some heuristics when importing from a file that is definitely a CommonJS module.</p> <p>One TypeScript-specific note about interop is the following syntax:</p> <pre data-language="ts">import foo = require("foo");</pre> <p>In a CommonJS module, this just boils down to a <code>require()</code> call, and in an ES module, this imports <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/module.html#module_module_createrequire_filename"><code>createRequire</code></a> to achieve the same thing. This will make code less portable on runtimes like the browser (which don’t support <code>require()</code>), but will often be useful for interoperability. In turn, you can write the above example using this syntax as follows:</p> <pre data-language="ts">// ./foo.cts
export function helper() {
    console.log("hello world!");
}

// ./bar.mts
import foo = require("./foo.cjs");

foo.helper()</pre> <p>Finally, it’s worth noting that the only way to import ESM files from a CJS module is using dynamic <code>import()</code> calls. This can present challenges, but is the behavior in Node.js today.</p> <p>You can <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_interoperability_with_commonjs">read more about ESM/CommonJS interop in Node.js here</a>.</p> <h3 id="packagejson-exports-imports-and-self-referencing" style="position:relative;">
<code>package.json</code> Exports, Imports, and Self-Referencing</h3> <p>Node.js supports <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_exports">a new field for defining entry points in <code>package.json</code> called <code>"exports"</code></a>. This field is a more powerful alternative to defining <code>"main"</code> in <code>package.json</code>, and can control what parts of your package are exposed to consumers.</p> <p>Here’s an <code>package.json</code> that supports separate entry-points for CommonJS and ESM:</p> <pre data-language="json">// package.json
{
    "name": "my-package",
    "type": "module",
    "exports": {
        ".": {
            // Entry-point for `import "my-package"` in ESM
            "import": "./esm/index.js",

            // Entry-point for `require("my-package") in CJS
            "require": "./commonjs/index.cjs",
        },
    },

    // CJS fall-back for older versions of Node.js
    "main": "./commonjs/index.cjs",
}</pre> <p>There’s a lot to this feature, <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html">which you can read more about on the Node.js documentation</a>. Here we’ll try to focus on how TypeScript supports it.</p> <p>With TypeScript’s original Node support, it would look for a <code>"main"</code> field, and then look for declaration files that corresponded to that entry. For example, if <code>"main"</code> pointed to <code>./lib/index.js</code>, TypeScript would look for a file called <code>./lib/index.d.ts</code>. A package author could override this by specifying a separate field called <code>"types"</code> (e.g. <code>"types": "./types/index.d.ts"</code>).</p> <p>The new support works similarly with <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html">import conditions</a>. By default, TypeScript overlays the same rules with import conditions - if you write an <code>import</code> from an ES module, it will look up the <code>import</code> field, and from a CommonJS module, it will look at the <code>require</code> field. If it finds them, it will look for a colocated declaration file. If you need to point to a different location for your type declarations, you can add a <code>"types"</code> import condition.</p> <pre data-language="json">// package.json
{
    "name": "my-package",
    "type": "module",
    "exports": {
        ".": {
            // Entry-point for TypeScript resolution - must occur first!
            "types": "./types/index.d.ts",

            // Entry-point for `import "my-package"` in ESM
            "import": "./esm/index.js",

            // Entry-point for `require("my-package") in CJS
            "require": "./commonjs/index.cjs",
        },
    },

    // CJS fall-back for older versions of Node.js
    "main": "./commonjs/index.cjs",

    // Fall-back for older versions of TypeScript
    "types": "./types/index.d.ts"
}</pre> <p>TypeScript also supports <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_imports">the <code>"imports"</code> field of <code>package.json</code></a> in a similar manner (looking for declaration files alongside corresponding files), and supports <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_self_referencing_a_package_using_its_name">packages self-referencing themselves</a>. These features are generally not as involved, but are supported.</p><div class="_attribution">
