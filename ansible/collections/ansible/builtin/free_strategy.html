In most cases, you can use the short plugin name <code>free</code> even without specifying the <code>collections:</code> keyword. However, we recommend you use the FQCN for easy linking to the plugin documentation and to avoid conflicting with other collections that may have the same strategy plugin name.</p> </div> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">New in version 2.0: </span>of ansible.builtin</p> </div>    <section id="synopsis"> <h2>Synopsis</h2> <ul class="simple"> <li>Task execution is as fast as possible per batch as defined by <code>serial</code> (default all). Ansible will not wait for other hosts to finish the current task before queuing more tasks for other hosts. All hosts are still attempted for the current task, but it prevents blocking new tasks for hosts that have already finished.</li> <li>With the free strategy, unlike the default linear strategy, a host that is slow or stuck on a specific task won’t hold up the rest of the hosts and tasks.</li> </ul> <section id="authors"> <h3>Authors</h3> <ul class="simple"> <li>Ansible Core Team</li> </ul> <div class="admonition hint"> <p class="admonition-title">Hint</p> <p>Configuration entries for each entry type have a low to high priority order. For example, a variable that is lower in the list will override a variable that is higher up.</p> </div> </section> <section id="collection-links"> <h3>Collection links</h3> <p class="ansible-links"> <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues" aria-role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener external">Issue Tracker</a> <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible" aria-role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener external">Repository (Sources)</a> <a href="index#communication-for-ansible-builtin" aria-role="button" target="_blank">Communication</a> </p></section> </section> </section><div class="_attribution">
