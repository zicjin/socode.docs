In most cases, you can use the short plugin name <code>host_pinned</code> even without specifying the <code>collections:</code> keyword. However, we recommend you use the FQCN for easy linking to the plugin documentation and to avoid conflicting with other collections that may have the same strategy plugin name.</p> </div> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">New in version 2.7: </span>of ansible.builtin</p> </div>    <section id="synopsis"> <h2>Synopsis</h2> <ul class="simple"> <li>Task execution is as fast as possible per host in batch as defined by <code>serial</code> (default all). Ansible will not start a play for a host unless the play can be finished without interruption by tasks for another host, i.e. the number of hosts with an active play does not exceed the number of forks. Ansible will not wait for other hosts to finish the current task before queuing the next task for a host that has finished. Once a host is done with the play, it opens it’s slot to a new host that was waiting to start. Other than that, it behaves just like the “free” strategy.</li> </ul> <section id="authors"> <h3>Authors</h3> <ul class="simple"> <li>Ansible Core Team</li> </ul> <div class="admonition hint"> <p class="admonition-title">Hint</p> <p>Configuration entries for each entry type have a low to high priority order. For example, a variable that is lower in the list will override a variable that is higher up.</p> </div> </section> <section id="collection-links"> <h3>Collection links</h3> <p class="ansible-links"> <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues" aria-role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener external">Issue Tracker</a> <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible" aria-role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener external">Repository (Sources)</a> <a href="index#communication-for-ansible-builtin" aria-role="button" target="_blank">Communication</a> </p></section> </section> </section><div class="_attribution">
