It acts as the reference server for ASGI.</p>  <h2 id="installing-daphne">Installing Daphne</h2> <p id="s-installing-daphne">You can install Daphne with <code>pip</code>:</p> <pre data-language="bash">python -m pip install daphne
</pre>   <h2 id="running-django-in-daphne">Running Django in Daphne</h2> <p id="s-running-django-in-daphne">When Daphne is installed, a <code>daphne</code> command is available which starts the Daphne server process. At its simplest, Daphne needs to be called with the location of a module containing an ASGI application object, followed by what the application is called (separated by a colon).</p> <p>For a typical Django project, invoking Daphne would look like:</p> <pre data-language="bash">daphne myproject.asgi:application
</pre> <p>This will start one process listening on <code>127.0.0.1:8000</code>. It requires that your project be on the Python path; to ensure that run this command from the same directory as your <code>manage.py</code> file.</p><div class="_attribution">
