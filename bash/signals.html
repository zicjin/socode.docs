  <h1 class="subsection">Signals</h1>  <p>When Bash is interactive, in the absence of any traps, it ignores <code>SIGTERM</code> (so that ‘<samp>kill 0</samp>’ does not kill an interactive shell), and <code>SIGINT</code> is caught and handled (so that the <code>wait</code> builtin is interruptible). When Bash receives a <code>SIGINT</code>, it breaks out of any executing loops. In all cases, Bash ignores <code>SIGQUIT</code>. If job control is in effect (see <a href="job-control">Job Control</a>), Bash ignores <code>SIGTTIN</code>, <code>SIGTTOU</code>, and <code>SIGTSTP</code>. </p> <p>Non-builtin commands started by Bash have signal handlers set to the values inherited by the shell from its parent. When job control is not in effect, asynchronous commands ignore <code>SIGINT</code> and <code>SIGQUIT</code> in addition to these inherited handlers. Commands run as a result of command substitution ignore the keyboard-generated job control signals <code>SIGTTIN</code>, <code>SIGTTOU</code>, and <code>SIGTSTP</code>. </p> <p>The shell exits by default upon receipt of a <code>SIGHUP</code>. Before exiting, an interactive shell resends the <code>SIGHUP</code> to all jobs, running or stopped. Stopped jobs are sent <code>SIGCONT</code> to ensure that they receive the <code>SIGHUP</code>. To prevent the shell from sending the <code>SIGHUP</code> signal to a particular job, it should be removed from the jobs table with the <code>disown</code> builtin (see <a href="job-control-builtins">Job Control Builtins</a>) or marked to not receive <code>SIGHUP</code> using <code>disown -h</code>. </p> <p>If the <code>huponexit</code> shell option has been set with <code>shopt</code> (see <a href="the-shopt-builtin">The Shopt Builtin</a>), Bash sends a <code>SIGHUP</code> to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits. </p> <p>If Bash is waiting for a command to complete and receives a signal for which a trap has been set, the trap will not be executed until the command completes. When Bash is waiting for an asynchronous command via the <code>wait</code> builtin, the reception of a signal for which a trap has been set will cause the <code>wait</code> builtin to return immediately with an exit status greater than 128, immediately after which the trap is executed. </p><div class="_attribution">
