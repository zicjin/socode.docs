  <h1 class="subsection">Letting Readline Type For You</h1> <dl compact> <dt>
<code id="complete ()">complete (<span class="key">TAB</span>)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Attempt to perform completion on the text before point. The actual completion performed is application-specific. Bash attempts completion treating the text as a variable (if the text begins with ‘<samp>$</samp>’), username (if the text begins with ‘<samp>~</samp>’), hostname (if the text begins with ‘<samp>@</samp>’), or command (including aliases and functions) in turn. If none of these produces a match, filename completion is attempted. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="possible-completions (M-?)">possible-completions (M-?)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>List the possible completions of the text before point. When displaying completions, Readline sets the number of columns used for display to the value of <code>completion-display-width</code>, the value of the environment variable <code>COLUMNS</code>, or the screen width, in that order. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="insert-completions (M-*)">insert-completions (M-*)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Insert all completions of the text before point that would have been generated by <code>possible-completions</code>. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="menu-complete ()">menu-complete ()</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Similar to <code>complete</code>, but replaces the word to be completed with a single match from the list of possible completions. Repeated execution of <code>menu-complete</code> steps through the list of possible completions, inserting each match in turn. At the end of the list of completions, the bell is rung (subject to the setting of <code>bell-style</code>) and the original text is restored. An argument of <var>n</var> moves <var>n</var> positions forward in the list of matches; a negative argument may be used to move backward through the list. This command is intended to be bound to <code>TAB</code>, but is unbound by default. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="menu-complete-backward ()">menu-complete-backward ()</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Identical to <code>menu-complete</code>, but moves backward through the list of possible completions, as if <code>menu-complete</code> had been given a negative argument. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="delete-char-or-list ()">delete-char-or-list ()</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Deletes the character under the cursor if not at the beginning or end of the line (like <code>delete-char</code>). If at the end of the line, behaves identically to <code>possible-completions</code>. This command is unbound by default. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="complete-filename (M-/)">complete-filename (M-/)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Attempt filename completion on the text before point. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="possible-filename-completions (C-x /)">possible-filename-completions (C-x /)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a filename. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="complete-username (M-~)">complete-username (M-~)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a username. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="possible-username-completions (C-x ~)">possible-username-completions (C-x ~)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a username. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="complete-variable (M-$)">complete-variable (M-$)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a shell variable. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="possible-variable-completions (C-x $)">possible-variable-completions (C-x $)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a shell variable. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="complete-hostname (M-@)">complete-hostname (M-@)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a hostname. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="possible-hostname-completions (C-x @)">possible-hostname-completions (C-x @)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a hostname. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="complete-command (M-!)">complete-command (M-!)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a command name. Command completion attempts to match the text against aliases, reserved words, shell functions, shell builtins, and finally executable filenames, in that order. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="possible-command-completions (C-x !)">possible-command-completions (C-x !)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a command name. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="dynamic-complete-history (M-)">dynamic-complete-history (M-<span class="key">TAB</span>)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Attempt completion on the text before point, comparing the text against lines from the history list for possible completion matches. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="dabbrev-expand ()">dabbrev-expand ()</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Attempt menu completion on the text before point, comparing the text against lines from the history list for possible completion matches. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="complete-into-braces (M-{)">complete-into-braces (M-{)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Perform filename completion and insert the list of possible completions enclosed within braces so the list is available to the shell (see <a href="brace-expansion">Brace Expansion</a>). </p> </dd> </dl><div class="_attribution">
