  <h1 class="subsection">Some Miscellaneous Commands</h1> <dl compact> <dt>
<code id="re-read-init-file (C-x C-r)">re-read-init-file (C-x C-r)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Read in the contents of the <var>inputrc</var> file, and incorporate any bindings or variable assignments found there. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="abort (C-g)">abort (C-g)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Abort the current editing command and ring the terminal’s bell (subject to the setting of <code>bell-style</code>). </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="do-lowercase-version (M-A, M-B, M-, …)">do-lowercase-version (M-A, M-B, M-<var>x</var>, …)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>If the metafied character <var>x</var> is upper case, run the command that is bound to the corresponding metafied lower case character. The behavior is undefined if <var>x</var> is already lower case. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="prefix-meta ()">prefix-meta (<span class="key">ESC</span>)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Metafy the next character typed. This is for keyboards without a meta key. Typing ‘<samp><span class="key">ESC</span> f</samp>’ is equivalent to typing <kbd>M-f</kbd>. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="undo (C-_ or C-x C-u)">undo (C-_ or C-x C-u)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Incremental undo, separately remembered for each line. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="revert-line (M-r)">revert-line (M-r)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Undo all changes made to this line. This is like executing the <code>undo</code> command enough times to get back to the beginning. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="tilde-expand (M-&amp;amp;)">tilde-expand (M-&amp;)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Perform tilde expansion on the current word. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="set-mark (C-@)">set-mark (C-@)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Set the mark to the point. If a numeric argument is supplied, the mark is set to that position. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="exchange-point-and-mark (C-x C-x)">exchange-point-and-mark (C-x C-x)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Swap the point with the mark. The current cursor position is set to the saved position, and the old cursor position is saved as the mark. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="character-search (C-])">character-search (C-])</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>A character is read and point is moved to the next occurrence of that character. A negative count searches for previous occurrences. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="character-search-backward (M-C-])">character-search-backward (M-C-])</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>A character is read and point is moved to the previous occurrence of that character. A negative count searches for subsequent occurrences. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="skip-csi-sequence ()">skip-csi-sequence ()</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Read enough characters to consume a multi-key sequence such as those defined for keys like Home and End. Such sequences begin with a Control Sequence Indicator (CSI), usually ESC-[. If this sequence is bound to "\e[", keys producing such sequences will have no effect unless explicitly bound to a readline command, instead of inserting stray characters into the editing buffer. This is unbound by default, but usually bound to ESC-[. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="insert-comment (M-#)">insert-comment (M-#)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Without a numeric argument, the value of the <code>comment-begin</code> variable is inserted at the beginning of the current line. If a numeric argument is supplied, this command acts as a toggle: if the characters at the beginning of the line do not match the value of <code>comment-begin</code>, the value is inserted, otherwise the characters in <code>comment-begin</code> are deleted from the beginning of the line. In either case, the line is accepted as if a newline had been typed. The default value of <code>comment-begin</code> causes this command to make the current line a shell comment. If a numeric argument causes the comment character to be removed, the line will be executed by the shell. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="dump-functions ()">dump-functions ()</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Print all of the functions and their key bindings to the Readline output stream. If a numeric argument is supplied, the output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part of an <var>inputrc</var> file. This command is unbound by default. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="dump-variables ()">dump-variables ()</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Print all of the settable variables and their values to the Readline output stream. If a numeric argument is supplied, the output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part of an <var>inputrc</var> file. This command is unbound by default. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="dump-macros ()">dump-macros ()</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Print all of the Readline key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output. If a numeric argument is supplied, the output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part of an <var>inputrc</var> file. This command is unbound by default. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="glob-complete-word (M-g)">glob-complete-word (M-g)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>The word before point is treated as a pattern for pathname expansion, with an asterisk implicitly appended. This pattern is used to generate a list of matching file names for possible completions. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="glob-expand-word (C-x *)">glob-expand-word (C-x *)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>The word before point is treated as a pattern for pathname expansion, and the list of matching file names is inserted, replacing the word. If a numeric argument is supplied, a ‘<samp>*</samp>’ is appended before pathname expansion. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="glob-list-expansions (C-x g)">glob-list-expansions (C-x g)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>The list of expansions that would have been generated by <code>glob-expand-word</code> is displayed, and the line is redrawn. If a numeric argument is supplied, a ‘<samp>*</samp>’ is appended before pathname expansion. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="display-shell-version (C-x C-v)">display-shell-version (C-x C-v)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Display version information about the current instance of Bash. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="shell-expand-line (M-C-e)">shell-expand-line (M-C-e)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Expand the line as the shell does. This performs alias and history expansion as well as all of the shell word expansions (see <a href="shell-expansions">Shell Expansions</a>). </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="history-expand-line (M-^)">history-expand-line (M-^)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Perform history expansion on the current line. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="magic-space ()">magic-space ()</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Perform history expansion on the current line and insert a space (see <a href="history-interaction">History Interaction</a>). </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="alias-expand-line ()">alias-expand-line ()</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Perform alias expansion on the current line (see <a href="aliases">Aliases</a>). </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="history-and-alias-expand-line ()">history-and-alias-expand-line ()</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Perform history and alias expansion on the current line. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="insert-last-argument (M-. or M-_)">insert-last-argument (M-. or M-_)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>A synonym for <code>yank-last-arg</code>. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="edit-and-execute-command (C-x C-e)">edit-and-execute-command (C-x C-e)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Invoke an editor on the current command line, and execute the result as shell commands. Bash attempts to invoke <code>$VISUAL</code>, <code>$EDITOR</code>, and <code>emacs</code> as the editor, in that order. </p> </dd> </dl><div class="_attribution">
