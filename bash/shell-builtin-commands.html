</tr> </table> <p>Builtin commands are contained within the shell itself. When the name of a builtin command is used as the first word of a simple command (see <a href="simple-commands">Simple Commands</a>), the shell executes the command directly, without invoking another program. Builtin commands are necessary to implement functionality impossible or inconvenient to obtain with separate utilities. </p> <p>This section briefly describes the builtins which Bash inherits from the Bourne Shell, as well as the builtin commands which are unique to or have been extended in Bash. </p> <p>Several builtin commands are described in other chapters: builtin commands which provide the Bash interface to the job control facilities (see <a href="job-control-builtins">Job Control Builtins</a>), the directory stack (see <a href="directory-stack-builtins">Directory Stack Builtins</a>), the command history (see <a href="bash-history-builtins">Bash History Builtins</a>), and the programmable completion facilities (see <a href="programmable-completion-builtins">Programmable Completion Builtins</a>). </p> <p>Many of the builtins have been extended by <small>POSIX</small> or Bash. </p> <p>Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented as accepting options preceded by ‘<samp>-</samp>’ accepts ‘<samp>--</samp>’ to signify the end of the options. The <code>:</code>, <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, and <code>test</code>/<code>[</code> builtins do not accept options and do not treat ‘<samp>--</samp>’ specially. The <code>exit</code>, <code>logout</code>, <code>return</code>, <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>shift</code> builtins accept and process arguments beginning with ‘<samp>-</samp>’ without requiring ‘<samp>--</samp>’. Other builtins that accept arguments but are not specified as accepting options interpret arguments beginning with ‘<samp>-</samp>’ as invalid options and require ‘<samp>--</samp>’ to prevent this interpretation. </p><div class="_attribution">
