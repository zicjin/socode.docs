Each construct begins with a reserved word or control operator and is terminated by a corresponding reserved word or operator. Any redirections (see <a href="redirections">Redirections</a>) associated with a compound command apply to all commands within that compound command unless explicitly overridden. </p> <p>In most cases a list of commands in a compound commandâ€™s description may be separated from the rest of the command by one or more newlines, and may be followed by a newline in place of a semicolon. </p> <p>Bash provides looping constructs, conditional commands, and mechanisms to group commands and execute them as a unit. </p><div class="_attribution">
