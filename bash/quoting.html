Quoting can be used to disable special treatment for special characters, to prevent reserved words from being recognized as such, and to prevent parameter expansion. </p> <p>Each of the shell metacharacters (see <a href="definitions">Definitions</a>) has special meaning to the shell and must be quoted if it is to represent itself. When the command history expansion facilities are being used (see <a href="history-interaction">History Interaction</a>), the <var>history expansion</var> character, usually ‘<samp>!</samp>’, must be quoted to prevent history expansion. See <a href="bash-history-facilities">Bash History Facilities</a>, for more details concerning history expansion. </p> <p>There are three quoting mechanisms: the <var>escape character</var>, single quotes, and double quotes. </p><div class="_attribution">
