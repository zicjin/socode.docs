<code id="kill-line (C-k)">kill-line (C-k)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Kill the text from point to the end of the line. With a negative numeric argument, kill backward from the cursor to the beginning of the current line. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="backward-kill-line (C-x Rubout)">backward-kill-line (C-x Rubout)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Kill backward from the cursor to the beginning of the current line. With a negative numeric argument, kill forward from the cursor to the end of the current line. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="unix-line-discard (C-u)">unix-line-discard (C-u)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Kill backward from the cursor to the beginning of the current line. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="kill-whole-line ()">kill-whole-line ()</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Kill all characters on the current line, no matter where point is. By default, this is unbound. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="kill-word (M-d)">kill-word (M-d)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Kill from point to the end of the current word, or if between words, to the end of the next word. Word boundaries are the same as <code>forward-word</code>. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="backward-kill-word (M-)">backward-kill-word (M-<span class="key">DEL</span>)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Kill the word behind point. Word boundaries are the same as <code>backward-word</code>. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="shell-kill-word (M-C-d)">shell-kill-word (M-C-d)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Kill from point to the end of the current word, or if between words, to the end of the next word. Word boundaries are the same as <code>shell-forward-word</code>. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="shell-backward-kill-word ()">shell-backward-kill-word ()</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Kill the word behind point. Word boundaries are the same as <code>shell-backward-word</code>. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="shell-transpose-words (M-C-t)">shell-transpose-words (M-C-t)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Drag the word before point past the word after point, moving point past that word as well. If the insertion point is at the end of the line, this transposes the last two words on the line. Word boundaries are the same as <code>shell-forward-word</code> and <code>shell-backward-word</code>. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="unix-word-rubout (C-w)">unix-word-rubout (C-w)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Kill the word behind point, using white space as a word boundary. The killed text is saved on the kill-ring. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="unix-filename-rubout ()">unix-filename-rubout ()</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Kill the word behind point, using white space and the slash character as the word boundaries. The killed text is saved on the kill-ring. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="delete-horizontal-space ()">delete-horizontal-space ()</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Delete all spaces and tabs around point. By default, this is unbound. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="kill-region ()">kill-region ()</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Kill the text in the current region. By default, this command is unbound. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="copy-region-as-kill ()">copy-region-as-kill ()</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Copy the text in the region to the kill buffer, so it can be yanked right away. By default, this command is unbound. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="copy-backward-word ()">copy-backward-word ()</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Copy the word before point to the kill buffer. The word boundaries are the same as <code>backward-word</code>. By default, this command is unbound. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="copy-forward-word ()">copy-forward-word ()</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Copy the word following point to the kill buffer. The word boundaries are the same as <code>forward-word</code>. By default, this command is unbound. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="yank (C-y)">yank (C-y)</code>  </dt> <dd>
<p>Yank the top of the kill ring into the buffer at point. </p> </dd> <dt>
<code id="yank-pop (M-y)">yank-pop (M-y)</code>  </dt> <dd><p>Rotate the kill-ring, and yank the new top. You can only do this if the prior command is <code>yank</code> or <code>yank-pop</code>. </p></dd> </dl><div class="_attribution">
