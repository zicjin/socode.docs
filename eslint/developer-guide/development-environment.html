<h1 id="development-environment">Development Environment</h1>
<p>ESLint has a very lightweight development environment that makes updating code fast and easy. This is a step-by-step guide to setting up a local development environment that will let you contribute back to the project.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-install-nodejs">Step 1: Install Node.js</h2>
<p>Go to <a href="https://nodejs.org/">https://nodejs.org/</a> to download and install the latest stable version for your operating system.</p>
<p>Most of the installers already come with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> but if for some reason npm doesn't work on your system, you can install it manually using the instructions on the site.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-fork-and-checkout-your-own-eslint-repository">Step 2: Fork and checkout your own ESLint repository</h2>
<p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/eslint/eslint">https://github.com/eslint/eslint</a> and click the "Fork" button. Follow the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">GitHub documentation</a> for forking and cloning.</p>
<p>Once you've cloned the repository, run <code>npm install</code> to get all the necessary dependencies:</p>
<pre>$ cd eslint
$ npm install</pre>
<p>You must be connected to the Internet for this step to work. You'll see a lot of utilities being downloaded.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-add-the-upstream-source">Step 3: Add the upstream source</h2>
<p>The <em>upstream source</em> is the main ESLint repository where active development happens. While you won't have push access to upstream, you will have pull access, allowing you to pull in the latest code whenever you want.</p>
<p>To add the upstream source for ESLint, run the following in your repository:</p>
<pre>git remote add upstream git@github.com:eslint/eslint.git</pre>
<p>Now, the remote <code>upstream</code> points to the upstream source.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-install-the-yeoman-generator">Step 4: Install the Yeoman Generator</h2>
<p><a href="http://yeoman.io">Yeoman</a> is a scaffold generator that ESLint uses to help streamline development of new rules. If you don't already have Yeoman installed, you can install it via npm:</p>
<pre><code>npm install -g yo
</code></pre>
<p>Then, you can install the ESLint Yeoman generator:</p>
<pre><code>npm install -g generator-eslint
</code></pre>
<p>Please see the <a href="https://github.com/eslint/generator-eslint">generator documentation</a> for instructions on how to use it.</p>
<h2 id="step-5-run-the-tests">Step 5: Run the tests</h2>
<p>Running the tests is the best way to ensure you have correctly set up your development environment. Make sure you're in the <code>eslint</code> directory and run:</p>
<pre>npm test</pre>
<p>The testing takes a few minutes to complete. If any tests fail, that likely means one or more parts of the environment setup didn't complete correctly. The upstream tests always pass.</p>
<h2 id="reference-information">Reference Information</h2>
<h3 id="workflow">Workflow</h3>
<p>Once you have your development environment installed, you can make and submit changes to the ESLint source files. Doing this successfully requires careful adherence to our <a href="contributing/pull-requests">pull-request submission workflow</a>.</p>
<h3 id="build-scripts">Build Scripts</h3>
<p>ESLint has several build scripts that help with various parts of development.</p>
<h4 id="npm-test">npm test</h4>
<p>The primary script to use is <code>npm test</code>, which does several things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lints all JavaScript (including tests) and JSON</li>
<li>Runs all tests on Node.js</li>
<li>Checks code coverage targets</li>
<li>Generates <code>build/eslint.js</code> for use in a browser</li>
<li>Runs a subset of tests in PhantomJS</li>
</ol>
<p>Be sure to run this after making changes and before sending a pull request with your changes.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The full code coverage report is output into <code>/coverage</code>.</p>
<h4 id="npm-run-lint">npm run lint</h4>
<p>Runs just the JavaScript and JSON linting on the repository</p>
<h4 id="npm-run-webpack">npm run webpack</h4>
<p>Generates <code>build/eslint.js</code>, a version of ESLint for use in the browser</p>
<h4 id="npm-run-docs">npm run docs</h4>
<p>Generates JSDoc documentation and places it into <code>/jsdoc</code>.</p><div class="_attribution">
