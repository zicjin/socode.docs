<p>In JavaScript regular expressions, it's syntactically valid to define a backreference to a group that belongs to another alternative part of the pattern, a backreference to a group that appears after the backreference, a backreference to a group that contains that backreference, or a backreference to a group that is inside a negative lookaround. However, by the specification, in any of these cases the backreference always ends up matching only zero-length (the empty string), regardless of the context in which the backreference and the group appear.</p>
<p>Backreferences that always successfully match zero-length and cannot match anything else are useless. They are basically ignored and can be removed without changing the behavior of the regular expression.</p>
<pre data-language="js">var regex = /^(?:(a)|\1b)$/;

regex.test("a"); // true
regex.test("b"); // true!
regex.test("ab"); // false

var equivalentRegex = /^(?:(a)|b)$/;

equivalentRegex.test("a"); // true
equivalentRegex.test("b"); // true
equivalentRegex.test("ab"); // false</pre>
<p>Useless backreference is a possible error in the code. It usually indicates that the regular expression does not work as intended.</p>
<h2 id="rule-details">Rule Details</h2>
<p>This rule aims to detect and disallow the following backreferences in regular expression:</p>
<ul>
<li>Backreference to a group that is in another alternative, e.g., <code>/(a)|\1b/</code>. In such constructed regular expression, the backreference is expected to match what's been captured in, at that point, a non-participating group.</li>
<li>Backreference to a group that appears later in the pattern, e.g., <code>/\1(a)/</code>. The group hasn't captured anything yet, and ECMAScript doesn't support forward references. Inside lookbehinds, which match backward, the opposite applies and this rule disallows backreference to a group that appears before in the same lookbehind, e.g., <code>/(?&lt;=(a)\1)b/</code>.</li>
<li>Backreference to a group from within the same group, e.g., <code>/(\1)/</code>. Similar to the previous, the group hasn't captured anything yet, and ECMAScript doesn't support nested references.</li>
<li>Backreference to a group that is in a negative lookaround, if the backreference isn't in the same negative lookaround, e.g., <code>/a(?!(b)).\1/</code>. A negative lookaround (lookahead or lookbehind) succeeds only if its pattern cannot match, meaning that the group has failed.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the ECMAScript specification, all backreferences listed above are valid, always succeed to match zero-length, and cannot match anything else. Consequently, they don't produce parsing or runtime errors, but also don't affect the behavior of their regular expressions. They are syntactically valid but useless.</p>
<p>This might be surprising to developers coming from other languages where some of these backreferences can be used in a meaningful way.</p>
<pre data-language="js">// in some other languages, this pattern would successfully match "aab"

/^(?:(a)(?=a)|\1b)+$/.test("aab"); // false</pre>
<p>Examples of <strong>incorrect</strong> code for this rule:</p>
<pre data-language="js">/*eslint no-useless-backreference: "error"*/

/^(?:(a)|\1b)$/; // reference to (a) into another alternative

/^(?:(a)|b(?:c|\1))$/; // reference to (a) into another alternative

/^(?:a|b(?:(c)|\1))$/; // reference to (c) into another alternative

/\1(a)/; // forward reference to (a)

RegExp('(a)\\2(b)'); // forward reference to (b)

/(?:a)(b)\2(c)/; // forward reference to (c)

/\k&lt;foo&gt;(?&lt;foo&gt;a)/; // forward reference to (?&lt;foo&gt;a)

/(?&lt;=(a)\1)b/; // backward reference to (a) from within the same lookbehind

/(?&lt;!(a)\1)b/; // backward reference to (a) from within the same lookbehind

new RegExp('(\\1)'); // nested reference to (\1)

/^((a)\1)$/; // nested reference to ((a)\1)

/a(?&lt;foo&gt;(.)b\1)/; // nested reference to (?&lt;foo&gt;(.)b\1)

/a(?!(b)).\1/; // reference to (b) into a negative lookahead

/(?&lt;!(a))b\1/; // reference to (a) into a negative lookbehind</pre>
<p>Examples of <strong>correct</strong> code for this rule:</p>
<pre data-language="js">/*eslint no-useless-backreference: "error"*/

/^(?:(a)|(b)\2)$/; // reference to (b)

/(a)\1/; // reference to (a)

RegExp('(a)\\1(b)'); // reference to (a)

/(a)(b)\2(c)/; // reference to (b)

/(?&lt;foo&gt;a)\k&lt;foo&gt;/; // reference to (?&lt;foo&gt;a)

/(?&lt;=\1(a))b/; // reference to (a), correctly before the group as they're in the same lookbehind

/(?&lt;=(a))b\1/; // reference to (a), correctly after the group as the backreference isn't in the lookbehind

new RegExp('(.)\\1'); // reference to (.)

/^(?:(a)\1)$/; // reference to (a)

/^((a)\2)$/; // reference to (a)

/a(?&lt;foo&gt;(.)b\2)/; // reference to (.)

/a(?!(b|c)\1)./; // reference to (b|c), correct as it's from within the same negative lookahead

/(?&lt;!\1(a))b/; // reference to (a), correct as it's from within the same negative lookbehind</pre>
<p>Please note that this rule does not aim to detect and disallow a potentially erroneous use of backreference syntax in regular expressions, like the use in character classes or an attempt to reference a group that doesn't exist. Depending on the context, a <code>\1</code>...<code>\9</code> sequence that is not a syntactically valid backreference may produce syntax error, or be parsed as something else (e.g., as a legacy octal escape sequence).</p>
<p>Examples of additional <strong>correct</strong> code for this rule:</p>
<pre data-language="js">/*eslint no-useless-backreference: "error"*/

// comments describe behavior in a browser

/^[\1](a)$/.test("\x01a"); // true. In a character class, \1 is treated as an octal escape sequence.
/^\1$/.test("\x01"); // true. Since the group 1 doesn't exist, \1 is treated as an octal escape sequence.
/^(a)\1\2$/.test("aa\x02"); // true. In this case, \1 is a backreference, \2 is an octal escape sequence.</pre>
