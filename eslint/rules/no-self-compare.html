<p>Comparing a variable against itself is usually an error, either a typo or refactoring error. It is confusing to the reader and may potentially introduce a runtime error.</p>
<p>The only time you would compare a variable against itself is when you are testing for <code>NaN</code>. However, it is far more appropriate to use <code>typeof x === 'number' &amp;&amp; isNaN(x)</code> or the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/isNaN">Number.isNaN ES2015 function</a> for that use case rather than leaving the reader of the code to determine the intent of self comparison.</p>

<pre data-language="js">/*eslint no-self-compare: "error"*/

var x = 10;
if (x === x) {

}</pre>
