<div class="innertube"> <h1 id="Introduction">1 Introduction</h1>  <p id="interoperability%20tutorial">This section informs on interoperability, that is, information exchange, between Erlang and other programming languages. The included examples mainly treat interoperability between Erlang and C.</p> <h2 id="purpose" class="title-link" onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-purpose-idm46').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-purpose-idm46').style.visibility = 'hidden';"> <div class="title-name">1.1 Purpose</div>  </h2> <p>The purpose of this tutorial is to describe different interoperability mechanisms that can be used when integrating a program written in Erlang with a program written in another programming language, from the Erlang programmer's perspective.</p> <h2 id="prerequisites" class="title-link" onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-prerequisites-idm49').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-prerequisites-idm49').style.visibility = 'hidden';"> <div class="title-name">1.2 Prerequisites</div>  </h2> <p>It is assumed that you are a skilled Erlang programmer, familiar with concepts such as Erlang data types, processes, messages, and error handling.</p> <p>To illustrate the interoperability principles, C programs running in a UNIX environment have been used. It is assumed that you have enough knowledge to apply these principles to the relevant programming languages and platforms.</p> <div class="note"> <div class="label">Note</div> <div class="content">

<p>For readability, the example code is kept as simple as possible. For example, it does not include error handling, which might be vital in a real-life system.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="footer"> <hr> <p>Copyright © 2000-2022 Ericsson AB.
