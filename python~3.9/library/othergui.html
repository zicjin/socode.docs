<p>PyGObject provides introspection bindings for C libraries using <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/">GObject</a>. One of these libraries is the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gtk.org/">GTK+ 3</a> widget set. GTK+ comes with many more widgets than Tkinter provides. An online <a class="reference external" href="https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/">Python GTK+ 3 Tutorial</a> is available.</p> </dd> <dt><a class="reference external" href="http://www.pygtk.org/">PyGTK</a></dt>

<p>PyGTK provides bindings for an older version of the library, GTK+ 2. It provides an object oriented interface that is slightly higher level than the C one. There are also bindings to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a>. An online <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/index.html">tutorial</a> is available.</p> </dd> <dt><a class="reference external" href="https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro">PyQt</a></dt>

<p>PyQt is a <strong class="program">sip</strong>-wrapped binding to the Qt toolkit. Qt is an extensive C++ GUI application development framework that is available for Unix, Windows and Mac OS X. <strong class="program">sip</strong> is a tool for generating bindings for C++ libraries as Python classes, and is specifically designed for Python.</p> </dd> <dt><a class="reference external" href="https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/">PySide2</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Also known as the Qt for Python project, PySide2 is a newer binding to the Qt toolkit. It is provided by The Qt Company and aims to provide a complete port of PySide to Qt 5. Compared to PyQt, its licensing scheme is friendlier to non-open source applications.</p> </dd> <dt><a class="reference external" href="https://www.wxpython.org">wxPython</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>wxPython is a cross-platform GUI toolkit for Python that is built around the popular <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a> (formerly wxWindows) C++ toolkit. It provides a native look and feel for applications on Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix systems by using each platformâ€™s native widgets where ever possible, (GTK+ on Unix-like systems). In addition to an extensive set of widgets, wxPython provides classes for online documentation and context sensitive help, printing, HTML viewing, low-level device context drawing, drag and drop, system clipboard access, an XML-based resource format and more, including an ever growing library of user-contributed modules.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> <p>PyGTK, PyQt, PySide2, and wxPython, all have a modern look and feel and more widgets than Tkinter. In addition, there are many other GUI toolkits for Python, both cross-platform, and platform-specific. See the <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming">GUI Programming</a> page in the Python Wiki for a much more complete list, and also for links to documents where the different GUI toolkits are compared.</p><div class="_attribution">
