<h1 id="main-top-level-script-environment">__main__ — Top-level script environment</h1>  <p id="module-__main__"><code>'__main__'</code> is the name of the scope in which top-level code executes. A module’s __name__ is set equal to <code>'__main__'</code> when read from standard input, a script, or from an interactive prompt.</p> <p>A module can discover whether or not it is running in the main scope by checking its own <code>__name__</code>, which allows a common idiom for conditionally executing code in a module when it is run as a script or with <code>python
-m</code> but not when it is imported:</p> <pre data-language="python">if __name__ == "__main__":
    # execute only if run as a script
    main()
</pre> <p>For a package, the same effect can be achieved by including a <code>__main__.py</code> module, the contents of which will be executed when the module is run with <code>-m</code>.</p><div class="_attribution">
