<h1>31.2. When to JIT?</h1>    <p>JIT compilation is beneficial primarily for long-running CPU-bound queries. Frequently these will be analytical queries. For short queries the added overhead of performing JIT compilation will often be higher than the time it can save.</p> <p>To determine whether JIT compilation should be used, the total estimated cost of a query (see <a class="xref" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/planner-stats-details.html" title="Chapter 70. How the Planner Uses Statistics">Chapter 70</a> and <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-query#RUNTIME-CONFIG-QUERY-CONSTANTS" title="19.7.2. Planner Cost Constants">Section 19.7.2</a>) is used. The estimated cost of the query will be compared with the setting of <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-query#GUC-JIT-ABOVE-COST">jit_above_cost</a>. If the cost is higher, JIT compilation will be performed. Two further decisions are then needed. Firstly, if the estimated cost is more than the setting of <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-query#GUC-JIT-INLINE-ABOVE-COST">jit_inline_above_cost</a>, short functions and operators used in the query will be inlined. Secondly, if the estimated cost is more than the setting of <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-query#GUC-JIT-OPTIMIZE-ABOVE-COST">jit_optimize_above_cost</a>, expensive optimizations are applied to improve the generated code. Each of these options increases the JIT compilation overhead, but can reduce query execution time considerably.</p> <p>These cost-based decisions will be made at plan time, not execution time. This means that when prepared statements are in use, and a generic plan is used (see <a class="xref" href="sql-prepare" title="PREPARE">PREPARE</a>), the values of the configuration parameters in effect at prepare time control the decisions, not the settings at execution time.</p> <blockquote class="note"> <h3 class="title">Note</h3> <p>If <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-query#GUC-JIT">jit</a> is set to <code class="literal">off</code>, or if no JIT implementation is available (for example because the server was compiled without <code class="literal">--with-llvm</code>), JIT will not be performed, even if it would be beneficial based on the above criteria. Setting <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-query#GUC-JIT">jit</a> to <code class="literal">off</code> has effects at both plan and execution time.</p> </blockquote> <p><a class="xref" href="sql-explain" title="EXPLAIN">EXPLAIN</a> can be used to see whether JIT is used or not. As an example, here is a query that is not using JIT:</p> <pre>
=# EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT SUM(relpages) FROM pg_class;
                                                 QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------​------------------------------------------
 Aggregate  (cost=16.27..16.29 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=0.303..0.303 rows=1 loops=1)
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on pg_class  (cost=0.00..15.42 rows=342 width=4) (actual time=0.017..0.111 rows=356 loops=1)
 Planning Time: 0.116 ms
 Execution Time: 0.365 ms
(4 rows)
</pre> <p>Given the cost of the plan, it is entirely reasonable that no JIT was used; the cost of JIT would have been bigger than the potential savings. Adjusting the cost limits will lead to JIT use:</p> <pre>
=# SET jit_above_cost = 10;
SET
=# EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT SUM(relpages) FROM pg_class;
                                                 QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------​------------------------------------------
 Aggregate  (cost=16.27..16.29 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=6.049..6.049 rows=1 loops=1)
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on pg_class  (cost=0.00..15.42 rows=342 width=4) (actual time=0.019..0.052 rows=356 loops=1)
 Planning Time: 0.133 ms
 JIT:
   Functions: 3
   Options: Inlining false, Optimization false, Expressions true, Deforming true
   Timing: Generation 1.259 ms, Inlining 0.000 ms, Optimization 0.797 ms, Emission 5.048 ms, Total 7.104 ms
 Execution Time: 7.416 ms
</pre> <p>As visible here, JIT was used, but inlining and expensive optimization were not. If <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-query#GUC-JIT-INLINE-ABOVE-COST">jit_inline_above_cost</a> or <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-query#GUC-JIT-OPTIMIZE-ABOVE-COST">jit_optimize_above_cost</a> were also lowered, that would change.</p>  <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter">  <table summary="Navigation footer"> <tr> <td width="40%" align="left">
