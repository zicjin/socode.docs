<h1>21.5. Default Roles</h1>    <p>PostgreSQL provides a set of default roles which provide access to certain, commonly needed, privileged capabilities and information. Administrators can GRANT these roles to users and/or other roles in their environment, providing those users with access to the specified capabilities and information.</p> <p>The default roles are described in <a class="xref" href="default-roles#DEFAULT-ROLES-TABLE" title="Table 21.1. Default Roles">Table 21.1</a>. Note that the specific permissions for each of the default roles may change in the future as additional capabilities are added. Administrators should monitor the release notes for changes.</p> <div class="table" id="DEFAULT-ROLES-TABLE"> <p class="title"><strong>Table 21.1. Default Roles</strong></p> <div class="table-contents"> <table class="table" summary="Default Roles"> <colgroup> <col class="col1"> <col class="col2"> </colgroup> <thead> <tr> <th>Role</th> <th>Allowed Access</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>pg_read_all_settings</td> <td>Read all configuration variables, even those normally visible only to superusers.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>pg_read_all_stats</td> <td>Read all pg_stat_* views and use various statistics related extensions, even those normally visible only to superusers.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>pg_stat_scan_tables</td> <td>Execute monitoring functions that may take <code class="literal">ACCESS SHARE</code> locks on tables, potentially for a long time.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>pg_monitor</td> <td>Read/execute various monitoring views and functions.

They grant a set of common privileges allowing the role to read various useful configuration settings, statistics and other system information normally restricted to superusers.</p> <p>The <code class="literal">pg_signal_backend</code> role is intended to allow administrators to enable trusted, but non-superuser, roles to send signals to other backends. Currently this role enables sending of signals for canceling a query on another backend or terminating its session. A user granted this role cannot however send signals to a backend owned by a superuser. See <a class="xref" href="functions-admin#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-SIGNAL" title="9.27.2. Server Signaling Functions">Section 9.27.2</a>.</p> <p>The <code class="literal">pg_read_server_files</code>, <code class="literal">pg_write_server_files</code> and <code class="literal">pg_execute_server_program</code> roles are intended to allow administrators to have trusted, but non-superuser, roles which are able to access files and run programs on the database server as the user the database runs as. As these roles are able to access any file on the server file system, they bypass all database-level permission checks when accessing files directly and they could be used to gain superuser-level access, therefore great care should be taken when granting these roles to users.</p> <p>Care should be taken when granting these roles to ensure they are only used where needed and with the understanding that these roles grant access to privileged information.</p> <p>Administrators can grant access to these roles to users using the <a class="xref" href="sql-grant" title="GRANT">GRANT</a> command, for example:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
GRANT pg_signal_backend TO admin_user;
