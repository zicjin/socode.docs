string join0 [(-q | --quiet)] [STRING...]
</pre>   <h2 id="description">Description</h2> <p><code>string join</code> joins its STRING arguments into a single string separated by SEP, which can be an empty string. Exit status: 0 if at least one join was performed, or 1 otherwise.</p> <p><code>string join0</code> joins its STRING arguments into a single string separated by the zero byte (NUL), and adds a trailing NUL. This is most useful in conjunction with tools that accept NUL-delimited input, such as <code>sort -z</code>. Exit status: 0 if at least one join was performed, or 1 otherwise.</p> <p>Because Unix uses NUL as the string terminator, passing the output of <code>string join0</code> as an <em>argument</em> to a command (via a <a class="reference internal" href="../language#expand-command-substitution"><span class="std std-ref">command substitution</span></a>) won't actually work. Fish will pass the correct bytes along, but the command won't be able to tell where the argument ends. This is a limitation of Unix' argument passing.</p>   <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2> <pre data-language="shell">&gt;_ seq 3 | string join ...
