<h1 id="cmd-suspend">suspend - suspend the current shell</h1>  <h2 id="suspend-suspend-the-current-shell">Synopsis</h2> <pre data-language="shell">suspend [--force]
</pre>   <h2 id="description">Description</h2> <p><code>suspend</code> suspends execution of the current shell by sending it a SIGTSTP signal, returning to the controlling process. It can be resumed later by sending it a SIGCONT. In order to prevent suspending a shell that doesn't have a controlling process, it will not suspend the shell if it is a login shell. This requirement is bypassed if the <code>--force</code> option is given or the shell is not interactive.</p>   <div class="_attribution">
