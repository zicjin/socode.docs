<h1 id="cmd-disown">disown - remove a process from the list of jobs</h1>  <h2 id="disown-remove-a-process-from-the-list-of-jobs">Synopsis</h2> <pre data-language="shell">disown [ PID ... ]
</pre>   <h2 id="description">Description</h2> <p><code>disown</code> removes the specified <a class="reference internal" href="../language#syntax-job-control"><span class="std std-ref">job</span></a> from the list of jobs. The job itself continues to exist, but fish does not keep track of it any longer.</p> <p>Jobs in the list of jobs are sent a hang-up signal when fish terminates, which usually causes the job to terminate; <code>disown</code> allows these processes to continue regardless.</p> <p>If no process is specified, the most recently-used job is removed (like <a class="reference internal" href="bg#cmd-bg"><span class="std std-ref">bg</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="fg#cmd-fg"><span class="std std-ref">fg</span></a>). If one or more PIDs are specified, jobs with the specified process IDs are removed from the job list. Invalid jobs are ignored and a warning is printed.</p> <p>If a job is stopped, it is sent a signal to continue running, and a warning is printed. It is not possible to use the <a class="reference internal" href="bg#cmd-bg"><span class="std std-ref">bg</span></a> builtin to continue a job once it has been disowned.</p> <p><code>disown</code> returns 0 if all specified jobs were disowned successfully, and 1 if any problems were encountered.</p>   <h2 id="example">Example</h2> <p><code>firefox &amp;; disown</code> will start the Firefox web browser in the background and remove it from the job list, meaning it will not be closed when the fish process is closed.</p> <p><code>disown (jobs -p)</code> removes all <a class="reference internal" href="jobs#cmd-jobs"><span class="std std-ref">jobs</span></a> from the job list without terminating them.</p>   <div class="_attribution">
