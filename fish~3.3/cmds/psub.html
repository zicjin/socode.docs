</pre>   <h2 id="description">Description</h2> <p>Some shells (e.g., ksh, bash) feature a syntax that is a mix between command substitution and piping, called process substitution. It is used to send the output of a command into the calling command, much like command substitution, but with the difference that the output is not sent through commandline arguments but through a named pipe, with the filename of the named pipe sent as an argument to the calling program. <code>psub</code> combined with a regular command substitution provides the same functionality.</p> <p>The following options are available:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<code>-f</code> or <code>--file</code> will cause psub to use a regular file instead of a named pipe to communicate with the calling process. This will cause <code>psub</code> to be significantly slower when large amounts of data are involved, but has the advantage that the reading process can seek in the stream. This is the default.</li> <li>
<code>-F</code> or <code>--fifo</code> will cause psub to use a named pipe rather than a file. You should only use this if the command produces no more than 8 KiB of output. The limit on the amount of data a FIFO can buffer varies with the OS but is typically 8 KiB, 16 KiB or 64 KiB. If you use this option and the command on the left of the psub pipeline produces more output a deadlock is likely to occur.</li> <li>
<code>-s</code> or <code>--suffix</code> will append SUFFIX to the filename.</li> </ul>   <h2 id="example">Example</h2> <pre data-language="shell">diff (sort a.txt | psub) (sort b.txt | psub)
# shows the difference between the sorted versions of files ``a.txt`` and ``b.txt``.

source-highlight -f esc (cpp main.c | psub -f -s .c)
# highlights ``main.c`` after preprocessing as a C source.
