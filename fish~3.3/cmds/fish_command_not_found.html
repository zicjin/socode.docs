</pre>   <h2 id="description">Description</h2> <p>When fish tries to execute a command and can't find it, it invokes this function.</p> <p>It can print a message to tell you about it, and it often also checks for a missing package that would include the command.</p> <p>Fish ships multiple handlers for various operating systems and chooses from them when this function is loaded, or you can define your own.</p> <p>It receives the full commandline as one argument per token, so $argv[1] contains the missing command.</p> <p>When you leave <code>fish_command_not_found</code> undefined (e.g. by adding an empty function file) or explicitly call <code>__fish_default_command_not_found_handler</code>, fish will just print a simple error.</p>   <h2 id="example">Example</h2> <p>A simple handler:</p> <pre data-language="shell">function fish_command_not_found
    echo Did not find command $argv[1]
end

&gt; flounder
Did not find command flounder
</pre> <p>Or the handler for OpenSUSE's command-not-found:</p> <pre data-language="shell">function fish_command_not_found
    /usr/bin/command-not-found $argv[1]
end
</pre> <p>Or the simple default handler:</p> <pre data-language="shell">function fish_command_not_found
    __fish_default_command_not_found_handler $argv
end
</pre>   <h2 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards compatibility</h2> <p>This command was introduced in fish 3.2.0. Previous versions of fish used the "fish_command_not_found" <a class="reference internal" href="../language#event"><span class="std std-ref">event</span></a> instead.</p> <p>To define a handler that works in older versions of fish as well, define it the old way:</p> <pre data-language="shell">function __fish_command_not_found_handler --on-event fish_command_not_found
     echo COMMAND WAS NOT FOUND MY FRIEND $argv[1]
end
</pre> <p>in which case fish will define a <code>fish_command_not_found</code> that calls it, or define a wrapper:</p> <pre data-language="shell">function fish_command_not_found
     echo "G'day mate, could not find your command: $argv"
end

function __fish_command_not_found_handler --on-event fish_command_not_found
     fish_command_not_found $argv
end
