<h1 id="cmd-case">case - conditionally execute a block of commands</h1>  <h2 id="case-conditionally-execute-a-block-of-commands">Synopsis</h2> <pre data-language="shell">switch VALUE; [case [WILDCARD...]; [COMMANDS...]; ...] end
</pre>   <h2 id="description">Description</h2> <p><code>switch</code> executes one of several blocks of commands, depending on whether a specified value matches one of several values. <code>case</code> is used together with the <code>switch</code> statement in order to determine which block should be executed.</p> <p>Each <code>case</code> command is given one or more parameters. The first <code>case</code> command with a parameter that matches the string specified in the switch command will be evaluated. <code>case</code> parameters may contain wildcards. These need to be escaped or quoted in order to avoid regular wildcard expansion using filenames.</p> <p>Note that fish does not fall through on case statements. Only the first matching case is executed.</p> <p>Note that command substitutions in a case statement will be evaluated even if its body is not taken. All substitutions, including command substitutions, must be performed before the value can be compared against the parameter.</p>   <h2 id="example">Example</h2> <p>Say $animal contains the name of an animal. Then this code would classify it:</p> <pre data-language="shell">switch $animal
    case cat
        echo evil
    case wolf dog human moose dolphin whale
        echo mammal
    case duck goose albatross
        echo bird
    case shark trout stingray
        echo fish
    # Note that the next case has a wildcard which is quoted
    case '*'
        echo I have no idea what a $animal is
end
</pre> <p>If the above code was run with <code>$animal</code> set to <code>whale</code>, the output would be <code>mammal</code>.</p> <p>If <code>$animal</code> was set to "banana", it would print "I have no idea what a banana is".</p>   <div class="_attribution">
