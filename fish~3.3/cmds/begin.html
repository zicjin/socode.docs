<h1 id="cmd-begin">begin - start a new block of code</h1>  <h2 id="begin-start-a-new-block-of-code">Synopsis</h2> <pre data-language="shell">begin; [COMMANDS...;] end
</pre>   <h2 id="description">Description</h2> <p><code>begin</code> is used to create a new block of code.</p> <p>A block allows the introduction of a new variable scope, redirection of the input or output of a set of commands as a group, or to specify precedence when using the conditional commands like <code>and</code>.</p> <p>The block is unconditionally executed. <code>begin; ...; end</code> is equivalent to <code>if true; ...; end</code>.</p> <p><code>begin</code> does not change the current exit status itself. After the block has completed, <code>$status</code> will be set to the status returned by the most recent command.</p>   <h2 id="example">Example</h2> <p>The following code sets a number of variables inside of a block scope. Since the variables are set inside the block and have local scope, they will be automatically deleted when the block ends.</p> <pre data-language="shell">begin
    set -l PIRATE Yarrr

    ...
end

echo $PIRATE
# This will not output anything, since the PIRATE variable
# went out of scope at the end of the block
</pre> <p>In the following code, all output is redirected to the file out.html.</p> <pre data-language="shell">begin
    echo $xml_header
    echo $html_header
    if test -e $file
        ...
    end
    ...
