<h1 id="cmd-for">for - perform a set of commands multiple times</h1>  <h2 id="for-perform-a-set-of-commands-multiple-times">Synopsis</h2> <pre data-language="shell">for VARNAME in [VALUES...]; COMMANDS...; end
</pre>   <h2 id="description">Description</h2> <p><code>for</code> is a loop construct. It will perform the commands specified by <code>COMMANDS</code> multiple times. On each iteration, the local variable specified by <code>VARNAME</code> is assigned a new value from <code>VALUES</code>. If <code>VALUES</code> is empty, <code>COMMANDS</code> will not be executed at all. The <code>VARNAME</code> is visible when the loop terminates and will contain the last value assigned to it. If <code>VARNAME</code> does not already exist it will be set in the local scope. For our purposes if the <code>for</code> block is inside a function there must be a local variable with the same name. If the <code>for</code> block is not nested inside a function then global and universal variables of the same name will be used if they exist.</p>   <h2 id="example">Example</h2> <pre data-language="shell">for i in foo bar baz; echo $i; end

# would output:
foo
bar
baz
</pre>   <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2> <p>The <code>VARNAME</code> was local to the for block in releases prior to 3.0.0. This means that if you did something like this:</p> <pre data-language="shell">for var in a b c
    if break_from_loop
        break
    end
end
echo $var
</pre> <p>The last value assigned to <code>var</code> when the loop terminated would not be available outside the loop. What <code>echo $var</code> would write depended on what it was set to before the loop was run. Likely nothing.</p>   <div class="_attribution">
