<h1 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</h1>  <h2 id="what-is-the-equivalent-to-this-thing-from-bash-or-other-shells">What is the equivalent to this thing from bash (or other shells)?</h2> <p>See <a class="reference internal" href="fish_for_bash_users#fish-for-bash-users"><span class="std std-ref">Fish for bash users</span></a></p>   <h2 id="how-do-i-set-or-clear-an-environment-variable">How do I set or clear an environment variable?</h2> <p>Use the <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/set#cmd-set"><span class="std std-ref">set</span></a> command:</p> <pre data-language="shell">set -x key value # typically set -gx key value
set -e key
</pre> <p>Since fish 3.1 you can set an environment variable for just one command using the <code>key=value some command</code> syntax, like in other shells. The two lines below behave identically - unlike other shells, fish will output <code>value</code> both times:</p> <pre data-language="shell">key=value echo $key
begin; set -lx key value; echo $key; end
</pre> <p>Note that "exported" is not a <a class="reference internal" href="language#variables-scope"><span class="std std-ref">scope</span></a>, but an additional bit of state. A variable can be global and exported or local and exported or even universal and exported. Typically it makes sense to make an exported variable global.</p>   <h2 id="how-do-i-check-whether-a-variable-is-defined">How do I check whether a variable is defined?</h2> <p>Use <code>set -q var</code>. For example, <code>if set -q var; echo variable defined; end</code>. To check multiple variables you can combine with <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> like so:</p> <pre data-language="shell">if set -q var1; or set -q var2
    echo either variable defined
end
</pre> <p>Keep in mind that a defined variabled could also be empty, either by having no elements (if set like <code>set var</code>) or only empty elements (if set like <code>set var ""</code>). Read on for how to deal with those.</p>   <h2 id="how-do-i-check-whether-a-variable-is-not-empty">How do I check whether a variable is not empty?</h2> <p>Use <code>string length -q -- $var</code>. For example, <code>if string length -q -- $var; echo not empty; end</code>. Note that <code>string length</code> will interpret a list of multiple variables as a disjunction (meaning any/or):</p> <pre data-language="shell">if string length -q -- $var1 $var2 $var3
    echo at least one of these variables is not empty
end
</pre> <p>Alternatively, use <code>test -n "$var"</code>, but remember that <strong>the variable must be double-quoted</strong>. For example, <code>if test -n "$var"; echo not empty; end</code>. The <code>test</code> command provides its own and (-a) and or (-o):</p> <pre data-language="shell">if test -n "$var1" -o -n "$var2" -o -n "$var3"
    echo at least one of these variables is not empty
end
</pre> <p>If you want to know if a variable has <em>no elements</em>, use <code>set -q var[1]</code>.</p>   <h2 id="why-doesn-t-set-ux-exported-universal-variables-seem-to-work">Why doesn't <code>set -Ux</code> (exported universal variables) seem to work?</h2> <p>A global variable of the same name already exists.</p> <p>Environment variables such as <code>EDITOR</code> or <code>TZ</code> can be set universally using <code>set -Ux</code>. However, if there is an environment variable already set before fish starts (such as by login scripts or system administrators), it is imported into fish as a global variable. The <a class="reference internal" href="language#variables-scope"><span class="std std-ref">variable scopes</span></a> are searched from the "inside out", which means that local variables are checked first, followed by global variables, and finally universal variables.</p> <p>This means that the global value takes precedence over the universal value.</p> <p>To avoid this problem, consider changing the setting which fish inherits. If this is not possible, add a statement to your <a class="reference internal" href="index#configuration"><span class="std std-ref">configuration file</span></a> (usually <code>~/.config/fish/config.fish</code>):</p> <pre data-language="shell">set -gx EDITOR vim
</pre>   <h2 id="how-do-i-run-a-command-every-login-what-s-fish-s-equivalent-to-bashrc-or-profile">How do I run a command every login? What's fish's equivalent to .bashrc or .profile?</h2> <p>Edit the file <code>~/.config/fish/config.fish</code> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1">1</a>, creating it if it does not exist (Note the leading period).</p> <dl class="footnote brackets"> <dt class="label" id="id2">
<code>1</code> </dt> <dd>
<p>The "~/.config" part of this can be set via $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, that's just the default.</p> </dd> </dl>   <h2 id="how-do-i-set-my-prompt">How do I set my prompt?</h2> <p>The prompt is the output of the <code>fish_prompt</code> function. Put it in <code>~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish</code>. For example, a simple prompt is:</p> <pre data-language="shell">function fish_prompt
    set_color $fish_color_cwd
    echo -n (prompt_pwd)
    set_color normal
    echo -n ' &gt; '
end
</pre> <p>You can also use the Web configuration tool, <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/fish_config#cmd-fish-config"><span class="std std-ref">fish_config</span></a>, to preview and choose from a gallery of sample prompts.</p> <p>If you want to modify your existing prompt, you can use <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/funced#cmd-funced"><span class="std std-ref">funced</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/funcsave#cmd-funcsave"><span class="std std-ref">funcsave</span></a> like:</p> <pre data-language="shell">&gt;_ funced fish_prompt
# This opens up your editor (set in $EDITOR).
# Modify the function,
# save the file and repeat to your liking.
# Once you are happy with it:
&gt;_ funcsave fish_prompt
</pre> <p>This also applies to <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/fish_right_prompt#cmd-fish-right-prompt"><span class="std std-ref">fish_right_prompt</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/fish_mode_prompt#cmd-fish-mode-prompt"><span class="std std-ref">fish_mode_prompt</span></a>.</p>   <h2 id="why-does-my-prompt-show-a-i">Why does my prompt show a <code>[I]</code>?</h2> <p>That's the <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/fish_mode_prompt#cmd-fish-mode-prompt"><span class="std std-ref">fish_mode_prompt</span></a>. It is displayed by default when you've activated vi mode using <code>fish_vi_key_bindings</code>.</p> <p>If you haven't activated vi mode on purpose, you might have installed a third-party theme that does it.</p> <p>If you want to change or disable this display, modify the <code>fish_mode_prompt</code> function, for instance via <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/funced#cmd-funced"><span class="std std-ref">funced</span></a>.</p>   <h2 id="how-do-i-customize-my-syntax-highlighting-colors">How do I customize my syntax highlighting colors?</h2> <p>Use the web configuration tool, <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/fish_config#cmd-fish-config"><span class="std std-ref">fish_config</span></a>, or alter the <a class="reference internal" href="interactive#variables-color"><span class="std std-ref">fish_color family of environment variables</span></a>.</p>   <h2 id="how-do-i-change-the-greeting-message">How do I change the greeting message?</h2> <p>Change the value of the variable <code>fish_greeting</code> or create a <code>fish_greeting</code> function. For example, to remove the greeting use:</p> <pre data-language="shell">set -U fish_greeting
</pre> <p>Or if you prefer not to use a universal variable, use:</p> <pre data-language="shell">set -g fish_greeting
</pre> <p>in config.fish.</p>   <h2 id="i-m-seeing-weird-output-before-each-prompt-when-using-screen-what-s-wrong">I'm seeing weird output before each prompt when using screen. What's wrong?</h2> <p>Quick answer:</p> <p>Run the following command in fish:</p> <pre data-language="shell">function fish_title; end; funcsave fish_title
</pre> <p>Problem solved!</p> <p>The long answer:</p> <p>Fish is trying to set the titlebar message of your terminal. While screen itself supports this feature, your terminal does not. Unfortunately, when the underlying terminal doesn't support setting the titlebar, screen simply passes through the escape codes and text to the underlying terminal instead of ignoring them. It is impossible to detect and resolve this problem from inside fish since fish has no way of knowing what the underlying terminal type is. For now, the only way to fix this is to unset the titlebar message, as suggested above.</p> <p>Note that fish has a default titlebar message, which will be used if the fish_title function is undefined. So simply unsetting the fish_title function will not work.</p>   <h2 id="how-do-i-run-a-command-from-history">How do I run a command from history?</h2> <p>Type some part of the command, and then hit the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">↑</kbd> (up) or <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">↓</kbd> (down) arrow keys to navigate through history matches. Additional default key bindings include <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Control</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">P</kbd> (up) and <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Control</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">N</kbd> (down). See <a class="reference internal" href="interactive#history-search"><span class="std std-ref">Searchable command history</span></a> for more information.</p>   <h2 id="why-doesn-t-history-substitution-etc-work">Why doesn't history substitution ("!$" etc.) work?</h2> <p>Because history substitution is an awkward interface that was invented before interactive line editing was even possible. Instead of adding this pseudo-syntax, fish opts for nice history searching and recall features. Switching requires a small change of habits: if you want to modify an old line/word, first recall it, then edit.</p> <p>As a special case, most of the time history substitution is used as <code>sudo !!</code>. In that case just press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">S</kbd>, and it will recall your last commandline with <code>sudo</code> prefixed (or toggle a <code>sudo</code> prefix on the current commandline if there is anything).</p> <p>In general, fish's history recall works like this:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Like other shells, the Up arrow, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">↑</kbd> recalls whole lines, starting from the last executed line. A single press replaces "!!", later presses replace "!-3" and the like.</li> <li>If the line you want is far back in the history, type any part of the line and then press Up one or more times. This will filter the recalled lines to ones that include this text, and you will get to the line you want much faster. This replaces "!vi", "!?bar.c" and the like.</li> <li>
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">↑</kbd> recalls individual arguments, starting from the last argument in the last executed line. A single press replaces "!$", later presses replace "!!:4" and such. As an alternate key binding, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">.</kbd> can be used.</li> <li>If the argument you want is far back in history (e.g. 2 lines back - that's a lot of words!), type any part of it and then press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">↑</kbd>. This will show only arguments containing that part and you will get what you want much faster. Try it out, this is very convenient!</li> <li>If you want to reuse several arguments from the same line ("!!:3*" and the like), consider recalling the whole line and removing what you don't need (<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">D</kbd> and <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Backspace</kbd> are your friends).</li> </ul> <p>See <a class="reference internal" href="interactive#editor"><span class="std std-ref">documentation</span></a> for more details about line editing in fish.</p>   <h2 id="how-do-i-run-a-subcommand-the-backtick-doesn-t-work">How do I run a subcommand? The backtick doesn't work!</h2> <p><code>fish</code> uses parentheses for subcommands. For example:</p> <pre data-language="shell">for i in (ls)
    echo $i
end
</pre>   <h2 id="my-command-pkg-config-gives-its-output-as-a-single-long-string">My command (pkg-config) gives its output as a single long string?</h2> <p>Unlike other shells, fish splits command substitutions only on newlines, not spaces or tabs or the characters in $IFS.</p> <p>That means if you run</p> <pre data-language="shell">echo x(printf '%s ' a b c)x
</pre> <p>It will print <code>xa b c x</code>, because the "a b c " is used in one piece. But if you do</p> <pre data-language="shell">echo x(printf '%s\n' a b c)x
</pre> <p>it will print <code>xax xbx xcx</code>.</p> <p>In the overwhelming majority of cases, splitting on spaces is unwanted, so this is an improvement.</p> <p>However sometimes, especially with <code>pkg-config</code> and related tools, splitting on spaces is needed.</p> <p>In these cases use <code>string split -n " "</code> like:</p> <pre data-language="shell">g++ example_01.cpp (pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-2.0 | string split -n " ")
</pre> <p>The <code>-n</code> is so empty elements are removed like POSIX shells would do.</p>   <h2 id="how-do-i-get-the-exit-status-of-a-command">How do I get the exit status of a command?</h2> <p>Use the <code>$status</code> variable. This replaces the <code>$?</code> variable used in some other shells.</p> <pre data-language="shell">somecommand
if test $status -eq 7
    echo "That's my lucky number!"
end
</pre> <p>If you are just interested in success or failure, you can run the command directly as the if-condition:</p> <pre data-language="shell">if somecommand
    echo "Command succeeded"
else
    echo "Command failed"
end
</pre> <p>Or if you just want to do one command in case the first succeeded or failed, use <code>and</code> or <code>or</code>:</p> <pre data-language="shell">somecommand
or someothercommand
</pre> <p>See the documentation for <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/test#cmd-test"><span class="std std-ref">test</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="cmds/if#cmd-if"><span class="std std-ref">if</span></a> for more information.</p>   <h2 id="my-command-prints-no-matches-for-wildcard-but-works-in-bash">My command prints "No matches for wildcard" but works in bash</h2> <p>In short: <a class="reference internal" href="language#quotes"><span class="std std-ref">quote</span></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="language#escapes"><span class="std std-ref">escape</span></a> the wildcard:</p> <pre data-language="shell">scp user@ip:/dir/"string-*"
</pre> <p>When fish sees an unquoted <code>*</code>, it performs <a class="reference internal" href="language#expand-wildcard"><span class="std std-ref">wildcard expansion</span></a>. That means it tries to match filenames to the given string.</p> <p>If the wildcard doesn't match any files, fish prints an error instead of running the command:</p> <pre data-language="shell">&gt; echo *this*does*not*exist
fish: No matches for wildcard '*this*does*not*exist'. See `help expand`.
echo *this*does*not*exist 2&gt;| xsel --clipboard
     ^
</pre> <p>Now, bash also tries to match files in this case, but when it doesn't find a match, it passes along the literal wildcard string instead.</p> <p>That means that commands like the above</p> <pre data-language="sh">scp user@ip:/dir/string-*
</pre> <p>or</p> <pre data-language="sh">apt install postgres-*
</pre> <p>appear to work, because most of the time the string doesn't match and so it passes along the <code>string-*</code>, which is then interpreted by the receiving program.</p> <p>But it also means that these commands can stop working at any moment once a matching file is encountered (because it has been created or the command is executed in a different working directory), and to deal with that bash needs workarounds like</p> <pre data-language="sh">for f in ./*.mpg; do
      # We need to test if the file really exists because
      # the wildcard might have failed to match.
      test -f "$f" || continue
      mympgviewer "$f"
done
</pre> <p>(from <a class="reference external" href="http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/004">http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/004</a>)</p> <p>For these reasons, fish does not do this, and instead expects asterisks to be quoted or escaped if they aren't supposed to be expanded.</p> <p>This is similar to bash's "failglob" option.</p>   <h2 id="i-accidentally-entered-a-directory-path-and-fish-changed-directory-what-happened">I accidentally entered a directory path and fish changed directory. What happened?</h2> <p>If fish is unable to locate a command with a given name, and it starts with <code>.</code>, <code>/</code> or <code>~</code>, fish will test if a directory of that name exists. If it does, it is implicitly assumed that you want to change working directory. For example, the fastest way to switch to your home directory is to simply press <code>~</code> and enter.</p>   <h2 id="how-can-i-use-as-a-shortcut-for-cd">How can I use <code>-</code> as a shortcut for <code>cd -</code>?</h2> <p>In fish versions prior to 2.5.0 it was possible to create a function named <code>-</code> that would do <code>cd -</code>. Changes in the 2.5.0 release included several bug fixes that enforce the rule that a bare hyphen is not a valid function (or variable) name. However, you can achieve the same effect via an abbreviation:</p> <pre data-language="shell">abbr -a -- - 'cd -'
</pre>   <h2 id="the-open-command-doesn-t-work">The open command doesn't work.</h2> <p>The <code>open</code> command uses the MIME type database and the <code>.desktop</code> files used by Gnome and KDE to identify filetypes and default actions. If at least one of these environments is installed, but the open command is not working, this probably means that the relevant files are installed in a non-standard location. Consider <a class="reference internal" href="index#more-help"><span class="std std-ref">asking for more help</span></a>.</p>   <h2 id="faq-ssh-interactive">Why won't SSH/SCP/rsync connect properly when fish is my login shell?</h2> <p id="why-won-t-ssh-scp-rsync-connect-properly-when-fish-is-my-login-shell">This problem may show up as messages like "<code>Received message too long</code>", "<code>open terminal
failed: not a terminal</code>", "<code>Bad packet length</code>", or "<code>Connection refused</code>" with strange output in <code>ssh_exchange_identification</code> messages in the debug log.</p> <p>This usually happens because fish reads the <a class="reference internal" href="index#configuration"><span class="std std-ref">user configuration file</span></a> (<code>~/.config/fish/config.fish</code>) <em>always</em>, whether it's in an interactive or login or non-interactive or non-login shell.</p> <p>This simplifies matters, but it also means when config.fish generates output, it will do that even in non-interactive shells like the one ssh/scp/rsync start when they connect.</p> <p>Anything in config.fish that produces output should be guarded with <code>status is-interactive</code> (or <code>status is-login</code> if you prefer):</p> <pre data-language="shell">if status is-interactive
  ...
end
</pre> <p>The same applies for example when you start <code>tmux</code> in config.fish without guards, which will cause a message like <code>sessions should be nested with care, unset $TMUX to force</code>.</p>   <h2 id="faq-unicode">I'm getting weird graphical glitches (a staircase effect, ghost characters, cursor in the wrong position,...)?</h2> <p id="i-m-getting-weird-graphical-glitches-a-staircase-effect-ghost-characters-cursor-in-the-wrong-position">In a terminal, the application running inside it and the terminal itself need to agree on the width of characters in order to handle cursor movement.</p> <p>This is more important to fish than other shells because features like syntax highlighting and autosuggestions are implemented by moving the cursor.</p> <p>Sometimes, there is disagreement on the width. There are numerous causes and fixes for this:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>It is possible the character is simply too new for your system to know - in this case you need to refrain from using it.</li> <li>Fish or your terminal might not know about the character or handle it wrong - in this case fish or your terminal needs to be fixed, or you need to update to a fixed version.</li> <li>The character has an "ambiguous" width and fish thinks that means a width of X while your terminal thinks it's Y. In this case you either need to change your terminal's configuration or set $fish_ambiguous_width to the correct value.</li> <li>The character is an emoji and the host system only supports Unicode 8, while you are running the terminal on a system that uses Unicode &gt;= 9. In this case set $fish_emoji_width to 2.</li> </ul> <p>This also means that a few things are unsupportable:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Non-monospace fonts - there is <em>no way</em> for fish to figure out what width a specific character has as it has no influence on the terminal's font rendering.</li> <li>Different widths for multiple ambiguous width characters - there is no way for fish to know which width you assign to each character.</li> </ul>   <h2 id="how-do-i-make-fish-my-default-shell">How do I make fish my default shell?</h2> <p>If you installed fish manually (e.g. by compiling it, not by using a package manager), you first need to add fish to the list of shells by executing the following command (assuming you installed fish in /usr/local):</p> <pre data-language="shell">echo /usr/local/bin/fish | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
</pre> <p>If you installed a prepackaged version of fish, the package manager should have already done this for you.</p> <p>In order to change your default shell, type:</p> <pre data-language="shell">chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish
</pre> <p>You may need to adjust the above path to e.g. <code>/usr/bin/fish</code>. Use the command <code>which fish</code> if you are unsure of where fish is installed.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there is no way to make the changes take effect at once. You will need to log out and back in again.</p>   <h2 id="faq-uninstalling">Uninstalling fish</h2> <p id="uninstalling-fish">If you want to uninstall fish, first make sure fish is not set as your shell. Run <code>chsh -s /bin/bash</code> if you are not sure.</p> <p>If you installed it with a package manager, just use that package manager's uninstall function. If you built fish yourself, assuming you installed it to /usr/local, do this:</p> <pre data-language="shell">rm -Rf /usr/local/etc/fish /usr/local/share/fish ~/.config/fish

rm -f fish fish_indent
</pre>   <h2 id="where-can-i-find-extra-tools-for-fish">Where can I find extra tools for fish?</h2> <p>The fish user community extends fish in unique and useful ways via scripts that aren't always appropriate for bundling with the fish package. Typically because they solve a niche problem unlikely to appeal to a broad audience.
