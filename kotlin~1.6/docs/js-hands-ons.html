<h1 data-toc="js-hands-ons" id="js-hands-ons.md">Hands-on labs for Kotlin/JS</h1>
<p id="78b8bdd5">Hands-on labs are long-form tutorials that help you get to know a technology by guiding you through a self-contained project related to a specific topic.</p>
<p id="16feb8f9">They include sample projects, which can serve as jumping-off points for your own projects, and contain useful snippets and patterns.</p>
<p id="ca6b2cdb">For Kotlin/JS, the following hands-on labs are currently available:</p>
<ul class="list _ul" id="dfb6f788">
<li class="list__item" id="8f4d4a14"><p><a href="https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/Building%20Web%20Applications%20with%20React%20and%20Kotlin%20JS/" id="f35ded1a" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building Web Applications with React and Kotlin/JS</a> guides you through the process of building a simple web application using the React framework, shows how a typesafe Kotlin DSL for HTML makes it convenient to build reactive DOM elements, and illustrates how to use third-party React components, and how to obtain information from APIs, while writing the whole application logic in pure Kotlin/JS.</p></li>
<li class="list__item" id="9115358f"><p><a href="https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/Full%20Stack%20Web%20App%20with%20Kotlin%20Multiplatform/" id="4b4e7f9f" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building a Full Stack Web App with Kotlin Multiplatform</a> teaches the concepts behind building an application that targets Kotlin/JVM and Kotlin/JS by building a client-server application that makes use of common code, serialization, and other multiplatform paradigms. It also provides a brief introduction into working with Ktor both as a server- and client-side framework.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="68682cd2">We are continuously working on expanding the set of hands-on labs to make it as easy as possible for you to learn more about Kotlin/JS and adjacent technologies.</p>
