<p id="b3990797">You can participate in the Kotlin Early Access Preview (EAP) to try out the latest Kotlin features before they are released.</p>
<p id="83e2ef7c">We ship a few Milestone (<em id="1cb0bee0" class="">M</em>) builds before every feature (<em id="c2152176" class="">1.x</em>) and incremental (<em id="5b2986c" class="">1.x.y</em>) release.</p>
<p id="8f179fcc">We’ll be very thankful if you find and report bugs to our issue tracker <a href="https://kotl.in/issue" id="3bd43b8b" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTrack</a>. It is very likely that we’ll be able to fix them before the final release, which means you won’t need to wait until the next Kotlin release for your issues to be addressed.</p>
