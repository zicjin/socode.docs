<span class="t-li">1)</span> Searches for the file in implementation-defined manner. The intent of this syntax is to search for the files under control of the implementation. Typical implementations search only standard include directories. The standard C++ library and the standard C library are implicitly included in these standard include directories. The standard include directories usually can be controlled by the user through compiler options. </div> <div class="t-li2">
<span class="t-li">2)</span> Searches for the file in implementation-defined manner. The intent of this syntax is to search for the files that are not controlled by the implementation.

<span class="t-li">3)</span> Preprocessor constant expression that evaluates to <code>1</code> if the file name is found and <code>​0​</code> if not. The program is ill-formed if the argument would not be a valid argument to the <code>#include</code> directive.</div> <h3 id="Notes">Notes</h3> <p>When a file is included, it is processed by <a href="../language/translation_phases" title="cpp/language/translation phases">translation phases</a> 1-4, which may include, recursively, expansion of the nested <code>#include</code> directives. To avoid repeated inclusion of the same file and endless recursion when a file includes itself, perhaps transitively, <i>header guards</i> are commonly used: the entire header is wrapped in.</p>
<div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">#ifndef FOO_H_INCLUDED /* any name uniquely mapped to file name */
#define FOO_H_INCLUDED
// contents of the file are here
#endif</pre></div> <p>Many compilers also implement the non-standard <a href="impl" title="cpp/preprocessor/impl"><code>pragma</code></a> <code>#pragma once</code> with similar effects: it disables processing of a file if the same file (where file identity is determined in OS-specific way) has already been included.</p>
<p>A <code>__has_include</code> result of <code>1</code> only means that a header or source file with the specified name exists. It does not mean that the header or source file, when included, would not cause an error or would contain anything useful. For example, on a C++ implementation that supports both C++14 and C++17 modes (and provides <code>__has_include</code> in its C++14 mode as a conforming extension), <code>__has_include(&lt;optional&gt;)</code> may be <code>1</code> in C++14 mode, but actually <code>#include &lt;optional&gt;</code> may cause an error.</p>
