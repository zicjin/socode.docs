   <h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading">Memory model</h1>            <p>Defines the semantics of computer memory storage for the purpose of the C++ abstract machine.</p>
<p>The memory available to a C++ program is one or more contiguous sequences of <i>bytes</i>. Each byte in memory has a unique <i>address</i>.</p>
<h3 id="Byte">Byte</h3> <p>A <i>byte</i> is the smallest addressable unit of memory. It is defined as a contiguous sequence of bits, large enough to hold <span class="t-rev-inl t-since-cxx14"><span>the value of any <code>UTF-8</code> code unit (256 distinct values) and of </span> <span><span class="t-mark-rev t-since-cxx14">(since C++14)</span></span></span>any member of the <i>basic execution character set</i> (<a href="translation_phases" title="cpp/language/translation phases">the 96 characters</a> that are required to be single-byte). Similar to C, C++ supports bytes of sizes 8 bits and greater.</p>
<p>The <a href="types" title="cpp/language/types">types</a> <code>char</code>, <code>unsigned char</code>, and <code>signed char</code> use one byte for both storage and <a href="objects" title="cpp/language/object">value representation</a>. The number of bits in a byte is accessible as <code><a href="../types/climits" title="cpp/types/climits">CHAR_BIT</a></code> or <code><a href="../types/numeric_limits"><span class="kw344">std::<span class="me2">numeric_limits</span></span></a><span class="sy1">&lt;</span><span class="kw4">unsigned</span> <span class="kw4">char</span><span class="sy1">&gt;</span><span class="sy4">::</span><span class="me2">digits</span></code>.</p>
<h3 id="Memory_location">Memory location</h3> <p>A <i>memory location</i> is.</p>
<ul>
<li> an object of <a href="type-id" title="cpp/language/type">scalar type</a> (arithmetic type, pointer type, enumeration type, or std::nullptr_t) </li>
<li> or the largest contiguous sequence of <a href="bit_field" title="cpp/language/bit field">bit fields</a> of non-zero length </li>
</ul> <p>Note: Various features of the language, such as <a href="reference" title="cpp/language/reference">references</a> and <a href="virtual" title="cpp/language/virtual">virtual functions</a>, might involve additional memory locations that are not accessible to programs but are managed by the implementation.</p>
<div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">struct S {
    char a;     // memory location #1
    int b : 5;  // memory location #2
    int c : 11, // memory location #2 (continued)
          : 0,
        d : 8;  // memory location #3
    struct {
        int ee : 8; // memory location #4
    } e;
} obj; // The object 'obj' consists of 4 separate memory locations</pre></div> <h3 id="Threads_and_data_races">Threads and data races</h3> <p>A thread of execution is a flow of control within a program that begins with the invocation of a top-level function by <code><a href="../thread/thread/thread" title="cpp/thread/thread/thread">std::thread::thread</a></code>, <code><a href="../thread/async" title="cpp/thread/async">std::async</a></code>, or other means.</p>
<p>Any thread can potentially access any object in the program (objects with automatic and thread-local <a href="storage_duration" title="cpp/language/storage duration">storage duration</a> may still be accessed by another thread through a pointer or by reference).</p>
<p>Different threads of execution are always allowed to access (read and modify) different <i>memory locations</i> concurrently, with no interference and no synchronization requirements.</p>
<p>When an <a href="eval_order" title="cpp/language/eval order">evaluation</a> of an expression writes to a memory location and another evaluation reads or modifies the same memory location, the expressions are said to <i>conflict</i>. A program that has two conflicting evaluations has a <i>data race</i> unless.</p>
<ul>
<li> both evaluations execute on the same thread or in the same <a href="../utility/program/signal#Signal_handler" title="cpp/utility/program/signal">signal handler</a>, or </li>
<li> both conflicting evaluations are atomic operations (see <code><a href="../atomic/atomic" title="cpp/atomic/atomic">std::atomic</a></code>), or </li>
<li> one of the conflicting evaluations <i>happens-before</i> another (see <code><a href="../atomic/memory_order" title="cpp/atomic/memory order">std::memory_order</a></code>) </li>
</ul> <p>If a data race occurs, the behavior of the program is undefined.</p>
<p>(in particular, release of a <code><a href="../thread/mutex" title="cpp/thread/mutex">std::mutex</a></code> is <i>synchronized-with</i>, and therefore, <i>happens-before</i> acquisition of the same mutex by another thread, which makes it possible to use mutex locks to guard against data races).</p>
<div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">int cnt = 0;
auto f = [&amp;]{cnt++;};
std::thread t1{f}, t2{f}, t3{f}; // undefined behavior</pre></div> <div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">std::atomic&lt;int&gt; cnt{0};
auto f = [&amp;]{cnt++;};
std::thread t1{f}, t2{f}, t3{f}; // OK</pre></div> <h3 id="Memory_order">Memory order</h3> <p>When a thread reads a value from a memory location, it may see the initial value, the value written in the same thread, or the value written in another thread. See <code><a href="../atomic/memory_order" title="cpp/atomic/memory order">std::memory_order</a></code> for details on the order in which writes made from threads become visible to other threads.</p>
<h3 id="Forward_progress">Forward progress</h3> <h4 id="Obstruction_freedom">Obstruction freedom</h4> <p>When only one thread that is not blocked in a standard library function executes an <a href="../atomic" title="cpp/atomic">atomic function</a> that is lock-free, that execution is guaranteed to complete (all standard library lock-free operations are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm#Obstruction-freedom" class="extiw" title="enwiki:Non-blocking algorithm">obstruction-free</a>).</p>
<h4 id="Lock_freedom">Lock freedom</h4> <p>When one or more lock-free atomic functions run concurrently, at least one of them is guaranteed to complete (all standard library lock-free operations are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm#Lock-freedom" class="extiw" title="enwiki:Non-blocking algorithm">lock-free</a> -- it is the job of the implementation to ensure they cannot be live-locked indefinitely by other threads, such as by continuously stealing the cache line).</p>
<h4 id="Progress_guarantee">Progress guarantee</h4> <p>In a valid C++ program, every thread eventually does one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> terminate </li>
<li> makes a call to an I/O library function </li>
<li> performs an access through a <a href="cv" title="cpp/language/cv">volatile</a> glvalue </li>
<li> performs an atomic operation or a synchronization operation </li>
</ul> <p>No thread of execution can execute forever without performing any of these observable behaviors.</p>
<p>Note that it means that a program with endless recursion or endless loop (whether implemented as a <a href="for" title="cpp/language/for">for-statement</a> or by looping <a href="goto" title="cpp/language/goto">goto</a> or otherwise) has <a href="ub" title="cpp/language/ub">undefined behavior</a>. This allows the compilers to remove all loops that have no observable behavior, without having to prove that they would eventually terminate.</p>
<p>A thread is said to <i>make progress</i> if it performs one of the execution steps above (I/O, volatile, atomic, or synchronization), blocks in a standard library function, or calls an atomic lock-free function that does not complete because of a non-blocked concurrent thread.</p>
<table class="t-rev-begin"> <tr class="t-rev t-since-cxx17">
<td> <h4 id="Concurrent_forward_progress"> Concurrent forward progress</h4> <p>If a thread offers <i>concurrent forward progress guarantee</i>, it will <i>make progress</i> (as defined above) in finite amount of time, for as long as it has not terminated, regardless of whether other threads (if any) are making progress.</p>
<p>The standard encourages, but doesn't require that the main thread and the threads started by <code><a href="../thread/thread" title="cpp/thread/thread">std::thread</a></code> offer concurrent forward progress guarantee.</p>
<h4 id="Parallel_forward_progress"> Parallel forward progress</h4> <p>If a thread offers <i>parallel forward progress guarantee</i>, the implementation is not required to ensure that the thread will eventually make progress if it has not yet executed any execution step (I/O, volatile, atomic, or synchronization), but once this thread has executed a step, it provides <i>concurrent forward progress</i> guarantees (this rule describes a thread in a thread pool that executes tasks in arbitrary order).</p>
<h4 id="Weakly_parallel_forward_progress"> Weakly parallel forward progress</h4> <p>If a thread offers <i>weakly parallel forward progress guarantee</i>, it does not guarantee to eventually make progress, regardless of whether other threads make progress or not.</p>
<p>Such threads can still be guaranteed to make progress by blocking with forward progress guarantee delegation: if a thread P blocks in this manner on the completion of a set of threads S, then at least one thread in S will offer a forward progress guarantee that is same or stronger than P. Once that thread completes, another thread in S will be similarly strengthened. Once the set is empty, P will unblock.</p>
