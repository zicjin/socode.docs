</table> <p>The keyword <code>this</code> is a <a href="value_category" title="cpp/language/value category">prvalue</a> <a href="expressions" title="cpp/language/expressions">expression</a> whose value is the address of the object, on which the member function is being called. It can appear in the following contexts:</p>
<div class="t-li1">
<span class="t-li">1)</span> Within the body of any non-static <a href="member_functions" title="cpp/language/member functions">member function</a>, including <a href="constructor" title="cpp/language/initializer list">member initializer list</a>
</div> <div class="t-li1">
<span class="t-li">2)</span> within the <a href="function" title="cpp/language/function">declaration</a> of a non-static member function anywhere after the (optional) cv-qualifier sequence, including <a href="except_spec" title="cpp/language/except spec">dynamic exception specification</a><span class="t-mark">(deprecated)</span>, <a href="noexcept_spec" title="cpp/language/noexcept spec">noexcept specification</a><span class="t-mark-rev t-since-cxx11">(C++11)</span>, and the trailing return type<span class="t-mark-rev t-since-cxx11">(since C++11)</span>
</div> <div class="t-li1">
<span class="t-li">3)</span> within <a href="data_members#Member_initialization" title="cpp/language/data members">default member initializer</a> <span class="t-mark-rev t-since-cxx11">(since C++11)</span>
</div> <p>The type of <code>this</code> in a member function of class <code>X</code> is <code>X*</code> (pointer to X). If the member function is <a href="member_functions" title="cpp/language/member functions">cv-qualified</a>, the type of <code>this</code> is <code>cv X*</code> (pointer to identically cv-qualified X). Since constructors and destructors cannot be cv-qualified, the type of <code>this</code> in them is always <code>X*</code>, even when constructing or destroying a const object.</p>
<p>When a non-static class member is used in any of the contexts where the <code>this</code> keyword is allowed (non-static member function bodies, member initializer lists, default member initializers), the implicit <code>this-&gt;</code> is automatically added before the name, resulting in a member access expression (which, if the member is a virtual member function, results in a virtual function call).</p>
<p>In class templates, <code>this</code> is a <a href="dependent_name" title="cpp/language/dependent name">dependent expression</a>, and explicit <code>this-&gt;</code> may be used to force another expression to become dependent.</p>
<p><a href="constructor" title="cpp/language/constructor" class="mw-redirect">During construction</a> of an object, if the value of the object or any of its subobjects is accessed through a glvalue that is not obtained, directly or indirectly, from the constructor's <code>this</code> pointer, the value of the object or subobject thus obtained is unspecified. In other words, the this pointer cannot be aliased in a constructor:</p>
<div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">extern struct D d;
struct D {
    D(int a) : a(a), b(d.a) {} // b(a) or b(this-&gt;a) would be correct
    int a, b;
};
D d = D(1);   // because b(d.a) did not obtain a through this, d.b is now unspecified</pre></div> <p>It is possible to execute <code>delete this;</code>, if the program can guarantee that the object was allocated by <code>new</code>, however, this renders every pointer to the deallocated object invalid, including the <code>this</code> pointer itself: after <code>delete this;</code> returns, such member function cannot refer to a member of a class (since this involves an implicit dereference of <code>this</code>) and no other member function may be called. This is used, for example, in the member function of the control block of <code><a href="../memory/shared_ptr" title="cpp/memory/shared ptr">std::shared_ptr</a></code> responsible for decrementing the reference count, when the last reference to the managed object goes out of scope.</p>
<div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">class ref

    // ...
    void incRef() { ++mnRef; }
    void decRef() { if (--mnRef == 0) delete this; }
};</pre></div> <h3 id="Example">Example</h3> <div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">class T
