   <h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading">Constructors and member initializer lists</h1>            <p>Constructor is a special non-static <a href="member_functions" title="cpp/language/member functions">member function</a> of a class that is used to initialize objects of its class type.</p>
<p>In the definition of a constructor of a class, <i>member initializer list</i> specifies the initializers for direct and virtual base subobjects and non-static data members. ( Not to be confused with <a href="../utility/initializer_list" title="cpp/utility/initializer list">std::initializer_list</a> ).</p>
<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2> <p>Constructors are declared using member <a href="function" title="cpp/language/function">function declarators</a> of the following form:</p>
<table class="t-sdsc-begin">  <tr class="t-sdsc"> <td> <span class="t-spar">class-name</span> <code>(</code> <span class="t-spar">parameter-list</span><span class="t-mark">(optional)</span> <code>)</code> <span class="t-spar">except-spec</span><span class="t-mark">(optional)</span> <span class="t-spar">attr</span><span class="t-mark">(optional)</span> </td> <td> (1) </td> <td class="t-sdsc-nopad"> </td>
</tr> 
</table> <p>Where <span class="t-spar">class-name</span> must name the current class (or current instantiation of a class template), or, when declared at namespace scope or in a friend declaration, it must be a qualified class name.</p>
<p>The only specifiers allowed in the <span class="t-spar">decl-specifier-seq</span> of a constructor declaration are <a href="friend" title="cpp/language/friend">friend</a>, <a href="inline" title="cpp/language/inline">inline</a>, <code>explicit</code> and <code>constexpr</code> (in particular, no return type is allowed). Note that <a href="member_functions" title="cpp/language/member functions">cv- and ref-qualifiers</a> are not allowed either; const and volatile semantics of an object under construction don't kick in until the most-derived constructor completes.</p>
<p>The body of a <a href="function" title="cpp/language/function">function definition</a> of any constructor, before the opening brace of the compound statement, may include the <i>member initializer list</i>, whose syntax is the colon character <code>:</code>, followed by the comma-separated list of one or more <span class="t-spar">member-initializers</span>, each of which has the following syntax.</p>

They are invoked when <a href="initialization" title="cpp/language/initialization">initialization</a> takes place, and they are selected according to the rules of initialization. The constructors without <code>explicit</code> specifier are <a href="converting_constructor" title="cpp/language/converting constructor">converting constructors</a>. The constructors with a <code>constexpr</code> specifier make their type a <a href="../named_req/literaltype" title="cpp/named req/LiteralType">LiteralType</a>. Constructors that may be called without any argument are <a href="default_constructor" title="cpp/language/default constructor">default constructors</a>. Constructors that take another object of the same type as the argument are <a href="copy_constructor" title="cpp/language/copy constructor">copy constructors</a> and <a href="move_constructor" title="cpp/language/move constructor">move constructors</a>.</p>
<p>Before the compound statement that forms the function body of the constructor begins executing, initialization of all direct bases, virtual bases, and non-static data members is finished. Member initializer list is the place where non-default initialization of these objects can be specified. For members that cannot be default-initialized, such as members of reference and const-qualified types, member initializers must be specified. No initialization is performed for <a href="union#Anonymous_unions" title="cpp/language/union">anonymous unions</a> or <a href="union#Union-like_class" title="cpp/language/union">variant members</a> that do not have a member initializer.</p>
<p>The initializers where <span class="t-spar">class-or-identifier</span> names a <a href="derived_class" title="cpp/language/derived class">virtual base class</a> are ignored during execution of constructors of any class that is not the most derived class of the object that's being constructed.</p>
<p>Names that appear in <span class="t-spar">expression-list</span> or <span class="t-spar">brace-init-list</span> are evaluated in scope of the constructor:</p>
<div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">class X {
    int a, b, i, j;
public:
    const int&amp; r;
    X(int i)
      : r(a) // initializes X::r to refer to X::a
      , b{i} // initializes X::b to the value of the parameter i
      , i(i) // initializes X::i to the value of the parameter i
      , j(this-&gt;i) // initializes X::j to the value of X::i
    { }
};</pre></div> <p>Exceptions that are thrown from member initializers may be handled by <a href="function-try-block" title="cpp/language/function-try-block">function-try-block</a>.</p>
<p>Member functions (including virtual member functions) can be called from member initializers, but the behavior is undefined if not all direct bases are initialized at that point.</p>
<p>For virtual calls (if the bases are initialized), the same rules apply as the rules for the virtual calls from constructors and destructors: virtual member functions behave as if the dynamic type of <code>*this</code> is the class that's being constructed (dynamic dispatch does not propagate down the inheritance hierarchy) and virtual calls (but not static calls) to <a href="abstract_class" title="cpp/language/abstract class">pure virtual</a> member functions are undefined behavior.</p>
