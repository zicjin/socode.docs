</div> <h3 id="Explanation">Explanation</h3> <p>For the first (non-array) form, <span class="t-spar">expression</span> must be a pointer to an object type or a class type <a href="implicit_cast" title="cpp/language/implicit cast" class="mw-redirect">contextually implicitly convertible</a> to such pointer, and its value must be either <i>null</i> or pointer to a non-array object created by a <a href="new" title="cpp/language/new">new-expression</a>, or a pointer to a base subobject of a non-array object created by a <a href="new" title="cpp/language/new">new-expression</a>. If <span class="t-spar">expression</span> is anything else, including if it is a pointer obtained by the array form of <a href="new" title="cpp/language/new">new-expression</a>, the behavior is <a href="ub" title="cpp/language/ub">undefined</a>.</p>
<p>For the second (array) form, <span class="t-spar">expression</span> must be a null pointer value or a pointer value previously obtained by an array form of <a href="new" title="cpp/language/new">new-expression</a>. If <span class="t-spar">expression</span> is anything else, including if it's a pointer obtained by the non-array form of <a href="new" title="cpp/language/new">new-expression</a>, the behavior is <a href="ub" title="cpp/language/ub">undefined</a>.</p>
<p>The result of the expression always has type <code>void</code>.</p>
<p>If the object being deleted has incomplete class type at the point of deletion, and the complete class has a non-trivial destructor or a deallocation function, the behavior is undefined.</p>
<p>If <span class="t-spar">expression</span> is not a null pointer <span class="t-rev-inl t-since-cxx20"><span>and the <a href="../memory/new/operator_delete" title="cpp/memory/new/operator delete"> deallocation function</a> is not a destroying delete</span> <span><span class="t-mark-rev t-since-cxx20">(since C++20)</span></span></span>, the <code>delete</code> expression invokes the <a href="destructor" title="cpp/language/destructor">destructor</a> (if any) for the object that's being destroyed, or for every element of the array being destroyed (proceeding from the last element to the first element of the array).</p>
<p>After that, whether or not an exception was thrown by any destructor, the delete expression invokes the <a href="../memory/new/operator_delete" title="cpp/memory/new/operator delete"> deallocation function</a>: either <code><a href="../memory/new/operator_delete"><span class="kw685">operator delete</span></a></code> (for the first version of the expression) or <code><a href="../memory/new/operator_delete"><span class="kw685">operator delete</span></a><span class="br0">[</span><span class="br0">]</span></code> (for the second version of the expression), <span class="t-rev-inl t-since-cxx14"><span>unless the matching new-expression was combined with another new-expression</span> <span><span class="t-mark-rev t-since-cxx14">(since C++14)</span></span></span>.</p>
<p>The deallocation function's name is <a href="lookup" title="cpp/language/lookup">looked up</a> in the scope of the dynamic type of the object pointed to by <span class="t-spar">expression</span>, which means class-specific deallocation functions, if present, are found before the global ones. If <code>::</code> is present in the <code>delete</code> expression, only the global namespace is examined by this lookup.</p>
<p>If lookup finds more than one deallocation function, the function to be called is selected as follows (see <a href="../memory/new/operator_delete" title="cpp/memory/new/operator delete">deallocation function</a> for a more detailed description of these functions and their effects):</p>
