</div> <h3 id="Explanation"> Explanation</h3> <p>For the first (non-array) form, <span class="t-spar">expression</span> must be a pointer to an object type or a class type <a href="implicit_conversion" title="cpp/language/implicit conversion">contextually implicitly convertible</a> to such pointer, and its value must be either <i>null</i> or pointer to a non-array object created by a <a href="new" title="cpp/language/new">new-expression</a>, or a pointer to a base subobject of a non-array object created by a <a href="new" title="cpp/language/new">new-expression</a>. The pointed-to type of <span class="t-spar">expression</span> must be <a href="reinterpret_cast#Type_aliasing" title="cpp/language/reinterpret cast"><i>similar</i></a> to the type of the object (or of a base subobject). If <span class="t-spar">expression</span> is anything else, including if it is a pointer obtained by the array form of <a href="new" title="cpp/language/new">new-expression</a>, the behavior is <a href="ub" title="cpp/language/ub">undefined</a>.</p>
<p>For the second (array) form, <span class="t-spar">expression</span> must be a null pointer value or a pointer value previously obtained by an array form of <a href="new" title="cpp/language/new">new-expression</a>. The pointed-to type of <span class="t-spar">expression</span> must be <a href="reinterpret_cast#Type_aliasing" title="cpp/language/reinterpret cast"><i>similar</i></a> to the element type of the array object. If <span class="t-spar">expression</span> is anything else, including if it's a pointer obtained by the non-array form of <a href="new" title="cpp/language/new">new-expression</a>, the behavior is <a href="ub" title="cpp/language/ub">undefined</a>.</p>
<p>The result of the expression always has type <code>void</code>.</p>
<p>If the object being deleted has incomplete class type at the point of deletion, and the complete class has a non-trivial destructor or a deallocation function, the behavior is undefined.</p>
<p>If <span class="t-spar">expression</span> is not a null pointer <span class="t-rev-inl t-since-cxx20"><span>and the <a href="../memory/new/operator_delete" title="cpp/memory/new/operator delete">deallocation function</a> is not a destroying delete</span> <span><span class="t-mark-rev t-since-cxx20">(since C++20)</span></span></span>, the <code>delete</code> expression invokes the <a href="destructor" title="cpp/language/destructor">destructor</a> (if any) for the object that's being destroyed, or for every element of the array being destroyed (proceeding from the last element to the first element of the array).</p>
<p>After that, whether or not an exception was thrown by any destructor, the delete expression invokes the <a href="../memory/new/operator_delete" title="cpp/memory/new/operator delete">deallocation function</a>: either <code><a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/operator_delete"><span class="kw691">operator delete</span></a></code> (for the first version of the expression) or <code><a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/operator_delete"><span class="kw691">operator delete</span></a><span class="br0">[</span><span class="br0">]</span></code> (for the second version of the expression)<span class="t-rev-inl t-since-cxx14"><span>, unless the matching new-expression was combined with another new-expression</span> <span><span class="t-mark-rev t-since-cxx14">(since C++14)</span></span></span>.</p>
<p>The deallocation function's name is <a href="lookup" title="cpp/language/lookup">looked up</a> in the scope of the dynamic type of the object pointed to by <span class="t-spar">expression</span>, which means class-specific deallocation functions, if present, are found before the global ones. If <code>::</code> is present in the <code>delete</code> expression, only the global namespace is examined by this lookup.</p>
<p>If lookup finds more than one deallocation function, the function to be called is selected as follows (see <a href="../memory/new/operator_delete" title="cpp/memory/new/operator delete">deallocation function</a> for a more detailed description of these functions and their effects):</p>

<p>If <span class="t-spar">expression</span> evaluates to a null pointer value, no destructors are called, and the deallocation function may or may not be called (it's unspecified), but the default deallocation functions are guaranteed to do nothing when passed a null pointer.</p>
