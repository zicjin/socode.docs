<li> <a href="incomplete_type" title="cpp/language/incomplete type" class="mw-redirect">incomplete types</a>, <a href="abstract_class" title="cpp/language/abstract class">abstract class types</a>, and arrays thereof are not allowed: in particular, a class <code>C</code> cannot have a non-static data member of type <code>C</code>, although it can have a non-static data member of type <code>C&amp;</code> (reference to C) or <code>C*</code> (pointer to C); </li>
<li> a non-static data member cannot have the same name as the name of the class if at least one user-declared constructor is present; </li>
<li> the <a href="auto" title="cpp/language/auto">auto specifier</a> cannot be used in a non-static data member declaration (although it is allowed for static data members that are <a href="static#Constant_static_members" title="cpp/language/static">initialized in the class definition</a>). </li>
</ul> <p>In addition, <a href="bit_field" title="cpp/language/bit field">bit field declarations</a> are allowed.</p>
<h3 id="Layout">Layout</h3> <p>When an object of some class <code>C</code> is created, each non-static data member of non-reference type is allocated in some part of the object representation of <code>C</code>. Whether reference members occupy any storage is implementation-defined, but their <a href="storage_duration" title="cpp/language/storage duration">storage duration</a> is the same as that of the object in which they are members.</p>
<p>For non-<a href="union" title="cpp/language/union">union</a> class types, members with the same <a href="access" title="cpp/language/access">member access</a> are always allocated so that the members declared later have higher addresses within a class object. Members with different access control are allocated in unspecified order (the compiler may group them together). Alignment requirements may necessitate padding between members, or after the last member of a class.</p>
<h3 id="Standard_layout">Standard layout</h3> <p>A class where all non-static data members have the same access control and certain other conditions are satisfied is known as <i>standard layout type</i> (see <a href="../named_req/standardlayouttype" title="cpp/named req/StandardLayoutType">StandardLayoutType</a> for the list of requirements).</p>
<p>Two standard-layout non-union class types may have a <i>common initial sequence</i> of non-static data members<span class="t-rev-inl t-since-cxx14"><span> and bit-fields</span> <span><span class="t-mark-rev t-since-cxx14">(since C++14)</span></span></span>, for a sequence of one or more initial members (in order of declaration), if the members have layout-compatible types<span class="t-rev-inl t-since-cxx14"><span> and if they are bit-fields, they have the same width</span> <span><span class="t-mark-rev t-since-cxx14">(since C++14)</span></span></span>.</p>

<p>Two standard-layout unions are called <i>layout-compatible</i> if they have the same number of non-static data members and corresponding non-static data members (in any order) have layout-compatible types.</p>
<p>Standard layout types have the following special properties:</p>
<table class="t-rev-begin"> <tr class="t-rev t-until-cxx14">
<td> <ul><li> If a standard-layout <a href="union" title="cpp/language/union">union</a> holds two (or more) standard-layout classes as members, and these classes have a common initial sequence of data members, it is well-defined to examine any member of that common initial sequence regardless of which member of the union is active. </li></ul> </td> <td><span class="t-mark-rev t-until-cxx14">(until C++14)</span></td>

Note that <a href="reinterpret_cast#Type_aliasing" title="cpp/language/reinterpret cast">strict aliasing</a> rules still apply to the result of such cast. </li>
<li> The macro <code><a href="../types/offsetof" title="cpp/types/offsetof">offsetof</a></code> may be used to determine the offset of any member from the beginning of a standard-layout class. </li>
