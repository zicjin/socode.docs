<p>It is only safe to invoke the destructor if all threads have been notified. It is not required that they have exited their respective wait functions: some threads may still be waiting to reacquire the associated lock, or may be waiting to be scheduled to run after reacquiring it.</p>
<p>The programmer must ensure that no threads attempt to wait on <code>*this</code> once the destructor has been started, especially when the waiting threads are calling the wait functions in a loop or are using the overloads of the wait functions that take a predicate.</p>
