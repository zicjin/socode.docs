<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Phoenix is a web development framework written in Elixir which implements the server-side Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. Many of its components and concepts will seem familiar to those of us with experience in other web frameworks like Ruby on Rails or Python's Django.</p>
<p>Phoenix provides the best of both worlds - high developer productivity <em>and</em> high application performance. It also has some interesting new twists like channels for implementing realtime features and pre-compiled templates for blazing speed.</p>
<p>If you are already familiar with Elixir, great! If not, there are a number of places to learn. The <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">Elixir guides</a> and the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/learning.html">Elixir learning resources page</a> are two great places to start.</p>
<p>The guides that you are currently looking at provide an overview of all parts that make Phoenix. Here is a rundown of what they provide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Introduction - the guides you are currently reading. They will cover how to get your first application up and running</p></li>
<li><p>Guides - in-depth guides covering the main components in Phoenix and Phoenix applications</p></li>
<li><p>Real-time components - in-depth guides covering Phoenix's built-in real-time components</p></li>
