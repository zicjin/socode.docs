<h1 id="releases">Releases</h1> <p>Since Homebrew 1.0.0 most Homebrew users (those who haven’t run a <code class="highlighter-rouge">dev-cmd</code> or set <code class="highlighter-rouge">HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER=1</code>) require tags on the <a href="https://github.com/homebrew/brew">Homebrew/brew repository</a> in order to get new versions of Homebrew. There are a few steps in making a new Homebrew release:</p> <ol> <li>Check the <a href="https://github.com/homebrew/brew/pulls">Homebrew/brew pull requests</a> and <a href="https://github.com/homebrew/brew/issues">issues</a> to see if there is anything pressing that needs to be fixed or merged before the next release. If so, fix and merge these changes.</li> <li>After no code changes have happened for at least a few hours (ideally 24 hours) and you are confident there’s no major regressions on the current <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch you can create a new Git tag. Ideally this should be signed with your GPG key. This can then be pushed to GitHub.</li> <li>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew release-notes --markdown $PREVIOUS_TAG</code> to generate the release notes for the release. <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases/new">Create a new release on GitHub</a> based on the new tag.</li> </ol> <p>If this is a major or minor release (e.g. X.0.0 or X.Y.0) then there are a few more steps:</p> <ol> <li>Before creating the tag you should delete any <code class="highlighter-rouge">odisabled</code> code, make any <code class="highlighter-rouge">odeprecated</code> code <code class="highlighter-rouge">odisabled</code> and add any new <code class="highlighter-rouge">odeprecations</code> that are desired.</li> <li>Write up a release notes blog post to <a href="https://brew.sh">https://brew.sh</a> e.g. <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew.sh/pull/319">brew.sh#319</a>. This should use <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew release-notes</code> as input but have the wording adjusted to be more human readable and explain not just what has changed but why.</li> <li>When the release has shipped and the blog post has been merged, tweet the blog post as the <a href="https://twitter.com/MacHomebrew">@MacHomebrew Twitter account</a> or tweet it yourself and retweet it with the @MacHomebrew Twitter account (credentials are in 1Password).</li> <li>Send the email to the Homebrew TinyLetter email list (credentials are in 1Password).</li> <li>Consider whether to submit it to other sources e.g. Hacker News, Reddit.</li> </ol> <ul> <li>Pros: gets a wider reach and user feedback</li> <li>Cons: negative comments are common and people take this as a chance to complain about Homebrew (regardless of their usage)</li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
