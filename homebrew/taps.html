<h1 id="taps-third-party-repositories">Taps (third-party repositories)</h1> <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">brew tap</code> adds more repositories to the list of formulae that <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew</code> tracks, updates, and installs from. By default, <code class="highlighter-rouge">tap</code> assumes that the repositories come from GitHub, but the command isn’t limited to any one location.</p> <h2 id="the-brew-tap-command">The <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew tap</code> command</h2> <ul> <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">brew tap</code> without arguments lists the currently tapped repositories. For example:</li> </ul> <pre data-language="sh">$ brew tap
homebrew/core
mistydemeo/tigerbrew
dunn/emacs</pre> <ul> <li> <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">brew tap &lt;user/repo&gt;</code> makes a shallow clone of the repository at https://github.com/user/repo. After that, <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew</code> will be able to work on those formulae as if they were in Homebrew’s canonical repository. You can install and uninstall them with <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew [un]install</code>, and the formulae are automatically updated when you run <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew update</code>. (See below for details about how <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew tap</code> handles the names of repositories.)</p> </li> <li> <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">brew tap &lt;user/repo&gt; &lt;URL&gt;</code> makes a shallow clone of the repository at URL. Unlike the one-argument version, URL is not assumed to be GitHub, and it doesn’t have to be HTTP. Any location and any protocol that Git can handle is fine.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">--full</code> to either the one- or two-argument invocations above to have Git make a complete clone rather than a shallow one. Full is the default for Homebrew developers.</p> </li> <li> <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">brew tap --repair</code> migrates tapped formulae from a symlink-based to directory-based structure. (This should only need to be run once.)</p> </li> <li> <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">brew untap user/repo [user/repo user/repo ...]</code> removes the given taps. The repositories are deleted and <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew</code> will no longer be aware of their formulae. <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew untap</code> can handle multiple removals at once.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="repository-naming-conventions-and-assumptions">Repository naming conventions and assumptions</h2> <ul> <li> <p>On GitHub, your repository must be named <code class="highlighter-rouge">homebrew-something</code> in order to use the one-argument form of <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew tap</code>. The prefix ‘homebrew-‘ is not optional. (The two-argument form doesn’t have this limitation, but it forces you to give the full URL explicitly.)</p> </li> <li> <p>When you use <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew tap</code> on the command line, however, you can leave out the ‘homebrew-‘ prefix in commands.</p> <p>That is, <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew tap username/foobar</code> can be used as a shortcut for the long version: <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew tap username/homebrew-foobar</code>. <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew</code> will automatically add back the ‘homebrew-‘ prefix whenever it’s necessary.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="formula-with-duplicate-names">Formula with duplicate names</h2> <p>If your tap contains a formula that is also present in <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core">homebrew/core</a>, that’s fine, but it means that you must install it explicitly by default.</p> <p>Whenever a <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew install foo</code> command is issued, <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew</code> will find which formula to use by searching in the following order:</p> <ul> <li>core formulae</li> <li>other taps</li> </ul> <p>If you need a formula to be installed from a particular tap, you can use fully qualified names to refer to them.</p> <p>You can create a tap for an alternative <code class="highlighter-rouge">vim</code> formula. The behaviour will be:</p> <pre data-language="sh">brew install vim                     # installs from homebrew/core
brew install username/repo/vim       # installs from your custom repository</pre> <p>As a result, we recommend you give formulae a different name if you want to make them easier to install. Note that there is (intentionally) no way of replacing dependencies of core formulae with those from taps.</p><div class="_attribution">
