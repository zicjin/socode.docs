<h1 id="how-to-create-and-maintain-a-tap">How to Create and Maintain a Tap</h1> <p><a href="taps">Taps</a> are external sources of Homebrew formulae and/or external commands. They can be created by anyone to provide their own formulae and/or external commands to any Homebrew user.</p> <h2 id="creating-a-tap">Creating a tap</h2> <p>A tap is usually a Git repository available online, but you can use anything as long as it’s a protocol that Git understands, or even just a directory with files in it. If hosted on GitHub, we recommend that the repository’s name start with <code class="highlighter-rouge">homebrew-</code> so the short <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew tap</code> command can be used. See the <a href="manpage">manpage</a> for more information on repository naming.</p> <p>Tap formulae follow the same format as the core’s ones, and can be added at the repository’s root, or under <code class="highlighter-rouge">Formula</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">HomebrewFormula</code> subdirectories. We recommend the latter options because it makes the repository organisation easier to grasp, and top-level files are not mixed with formulae.</p> <p>See <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core">homebrew/core</a> for an example of a tap with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Formula</code> subdirectory.</p> <h2 id="naming-your-formulae-to-avoid-clashes">Naming your formulae to avoid clashes</h2> <p>If your formulae have the same name as Homebrew/homebrew-core formulae they cannot be installed side-by-side. If you wish to create a different version of a formula that’s in Homebrew/homebrew-core (e.g. with <code class="highlighter-rouge">option</code>s) consider giving it a different name e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">nginx-full</code> for more fully-featured <code class="highlighter-rouge">nginx</code> formula. This will allow both <code class="highlighter-rouge">nginx</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">nginx-full</code> to be installed at the same time (but not linked if there are conflicts and one of them is not declared to be <code class="highlighter-rouge">keg_only</code>).</p> <h3 id="installing">Installing</h3> <p>If it’s on GitHub, users can install any of your formulae with <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew install user/repo/formula</code>. Homebrew will automatically add your <code class="highlighter-rouge">github.com/user/homebrew-repo</code> tap before installing the formula. <code class="highlighter-rouge">user/repo/formula</code> points to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">github.com/user/homebrew-repo/**/formula.rb</code> file here.</p> <p>If they want to get your tap without installing any formula at the same time, users can add it with the <a href="taps"><code class="highlighter-rouge">brew tap</code> command</a>.</p> <p>If it’s on GitHub, they can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew tap user/repo</code>, where <code class="highlighter-rouge">user</code> is your GitHub username and <code class="highlighter-rouge">homebrew-repo</code> your repository.</p> <p>If it’s hosted outside of GitHub, they have to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew tap user/repo &lt;URL&gt;</code>, where <code class="highlighter-rouge">user</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">repo</code> will be used to refer to your tap and <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;URL&gt;</code> is your Git clone URL.</p> <p>Users can then install your formulae either with <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew install foo</code> if there’s no core formula with the same name, or with <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew install user/repo/foo</code> to avoid conflicts.</p> <h2 id="maintaining-a-tap">Maintaining a tap</h2> <p>A tap is just a Git repository so you don’t have to do anything specific when making modifications, apart from committing and pushing your changes.</p> <h3 id="updating">Updating</h3> <p>Once your tap is installed, Homebrew will update it each time a user runs <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew update</code>. Outdated formulae will be upgraded when a user runs <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew upgrade</code>, like core formulae.</p> <h2 id="external-commands">External commands</h2> <p>You can provide your tap users with custom <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew</code> commands by adding them in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">cmd</code> subdirectory. <a href="external-commands">Read more on external commands</a>.</p> <p>See <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-aliases">homebrew/aliases</a> for an example of a tap with external commands.</p><div class="_attribution">
