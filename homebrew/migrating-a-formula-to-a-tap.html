<h1 id="migrating-a-formula-to-a-tap">Migrating A Formula To A Tap</h1> <p>There are times when we may wish to migrate a formula from one tap into another tap. To do this:</p> <ol> <li>Create a pull request to the new tap adding the formula file as-is from the original tap. Fix any test failures that may occur due to the stricter requirements for new formulae than existing formula (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew audit --strict</code> must pass for that formula).</li> <li>Create a pull request to the original tap deleting the formula file and add it to <code class="highlighter-rouge">tap_migrations.json</code> with a commit message like <code class="highlighter-rouge">gv: migrate to homebrew/core</code>.</li> <li>Put a link for each pull request in the other pull request so the maintainers can merge them both at once.</li> </ol> <p>Congratulations, youâ€™ve moved a formula to a tap!</p><div class="_attribution">
