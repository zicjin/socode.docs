<code class="highlighter-rouge">brew</code> complains about absence of “Command Line Tools”</h3> <p>You need to have the Xcode Command Line Utilities installed (and updated): run <code class="highlighter-rouge">xcode-select --install</code> in the terminal.</p> <h3 id="ruby-bad-interpreter-usrbinrubym-no-such-file-or-directory">Ruby: <code class="highlighter-rouge">bad interpreter: /usr/bin/ruby^M: no such file or directory</code>
</h3> <p>You cloned with <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code>, and your Git configuration is set to use Windows line endings. See this page: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings">https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings</a></p> <h3 id="ruby-bad-interpreter-usrbinruby">Ruby: <code class="highlighter-rouge">bad interpreter: /usr/bin/ruby</code>
</h3> <p>You don’t have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/bin/ruby</code> or it is not executable. It’s not recommended to let this persist; you’d be surprised how many <code class="highlighter-rouge">.app</code>s, tools and scripts expect your macOS-provided files and directories to be <em>unmodified</em> since macOS was installed.</p> <h3 id="brew-update-complains-about-untracked-working-tree-files">
<code class="highlighter-rouge">brew update</code> complains about untracked working tree files</h3> <p>After running <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew update</code>, you receive a Git error warning about untracked files or local changes that would be overwritten by a checkout or merge, followed by a list of files inside your Homebrew installation.</p> <p>This is caused by an old bug in in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">update</code> code that has long since been fixed. However, the nature of the bug requires that you do the following:</p> <pre data-language="sh">cd $(brew --repository)
git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD</pre> <p>If <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew doctor</code> still complains about uncommitted modifications, also run this command:</p> <pre data-language="sh">cd $(brew --repository)/Library
git clean -fd</pre> <h3 id="launchctl-refuses-to-load-launchd-plist-files">
<code class="highlighter-rouge">launchctl</code> refuses to load launchd plist files</h3> <p>When trying to load a plist file into launchctl, you receive an error that resembles</p> <pre>Bug: launchctl.c:2325 (23930):13: (dbfd = open(g_job_overrides_db_path, [...]
launch_msg(): Socket is not connected</pre> <p>or</p> <pre>Could not open job overrides database at: /private/var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist: 13: Permission denied
launch_msg(): Socket is not connected</pre> <p>These are likely due to one of four issues:</p> <ol> <li>You are using iTerm. The solution is to use Terminal.app when interacting with <code class="highlighter-rouge">launchctl</code>.</li> <li>You are using a terminal multiplexer such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">tmux</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">screen</code>. You should interact with <code class="highlighter-rouge">launchctl</code> from a separate Terminal.app shell.</li> <li>You are attempting to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">launchctl</code> while logged in remotely. You should enable screen sharing on the remote machine and issue the command using Terminal.app running on that machine.</li> <li>You are <code class="highlighter-rouge">su</code>‘ed as a different user.</li> </ol> <h3 id="brew-upgrade-errors-out">
<code class="highlighter-rouge">brew upgrade</code> errors out</h3> <p>When running <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew upgrade</code>, you see something like this:</p> <pre>$ brew upgrade
