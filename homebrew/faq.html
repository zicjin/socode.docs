This can be surprising.</p> <p>To remove a formula entirely, you may run <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew uninstall --force &lt;formula&gt;</code>.</p> <p>Be careful as this is a destructive operation.</p> <h2 id="where-does-stuff-get-downloaded">Where does stuff get downloaded?</h2> <pre>brew --cache</pre> <p>Which is usually: <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/Library/Caches/Homebrew</code></p> <h2 id="my-mac-apps-dont-find-usrlocalbin-utilities">My Mac <code class="highlighter-rouge">.app</code>s don‚Äôt find <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/local/bin</code> utilities!</h2> <p>GUI apps on macOS don‚Äôt have <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/local/bin</code> in their <code class="highlighter-rouge">PATH</code> by default. If you‚Äôre on Mountain Lion or later, you can fix this by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo launchctl config user path "/usr/local/bin:$PATH"</code> and then rebooting, as documented in <code class="highlighter-rouge">man launchctl</code>. Note that this sets the launchctl PATH for <em>all users</em>.

These pre-compiled versions are referred to as <a href="bottles">bottles</a> and are available at <a href="https://bintray.com/homebrew/bottles">https://bintray.com/homebrew/bottles</a>.</p> <p>If available, bottled binaries will be used by default except under the following conditions:</p> <ul> <li>Options were passed to the install command, i.e. <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew install &lt;formula&gt;</code> will use a bottled version of the formula, but <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew install --enable-bar &lt;formula&gt;</code> will trigger a source build.</li> <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">--build-from-source</code> option is invoked.</li> <li>The machine is not running a supported version of macOS as all bottled builds are generated only for supported macOS versions.</li> <li>Homebrew is installed to a prefix other than the standard <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/local</code> (although some bottles support this).</li> </ul> <p>We aim to bottle everything.</p> <h2 id="how-do-i-get-a-formula-from-someone-elses-branch">How do I get a formula from someone else‚Äôs branch?</h2> <pre data-language="sh">brew install hub
brew update
cd $(brew --repository)
hub pull someone_else</pre> <p>Or:</p> <pre>brew pull https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/1234</pre> <h2 id="why-does-homebrew-prefer-i-install-to-usrlocal">Why does Homebrew prefer I install to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/local</code>?</h2> <ol> <li>
<strong>It‚Äôs easier</strong><br><code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/local/bin</code> is already in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">PATH</code>.</li> <li>
<strong>It‚Äôs easier</strong><br>Tons of build scripts break if their dependencies aren‚Äôt in either <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/local</code>. We fix this for Homebrew formulae (although we don‚Äôt always test for it), but you‚Äôll find that many RubyGems and Python setup scripts break which is something outside our control.</li> <li>
<strong>It‚Äôs safe</strong><br>Apple has assigned this directory for non-system utilities. This means there are no files in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/local</code> by default, so there is no need to worry about messing up existing or system tools.</li> </ol> <p><strong>If you plan to install gems that depend on brews then save yourself a bunch of hassle and install to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/local</code>!</strong></p> <p>It is not always straightforward to tell <code class="highlighter-rouge">gem</code> to look in non-standard directories for headers and libraries. If you choose <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/local</code>, many things will ‚Äújust work‚Äù.</p> <h2 id="why-does-homebrew-say-sudo-is-bad">Why does Homebrew say sudo is bad?</h2> <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Sudo is dangerous, and you installed TextMate.app without sudo anyway.</p> <p>Homebrew refuses to work using sudo.</p> <p>You should only ever sudo a tool you trust. Of course, you can trust Homebrew üòâ But do you trust the multi-megabyte Makefile that Homebrew runs? Developers often understand C++ far better than they understand make syntax. It‚Äôs too high a risk to sudo such stuff. It could modify (or upload) any files on your system. And indeed, we‚Äôve seen some build scripts try to modify <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr</code> even when the prefix was specified as something else entirely.</p> <p>We use the macOS sandbox to stop this but this doesn‚Äôt work when run as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">root</code> user (which also has read and write access to almost everything on the system).</p> <p>Did you <code class="highlighter-rouge">chown root /Applications/TextMate.app</code>? Probably not. So is it that important to <code class="highlighter-rouge">chown root wget</code>?</p> <p>If you need to run Homebrew in a multi-user environment, consider creating a separate user account especially for use of Homebrew.</p> <h2 id="why-isnt-a-particular-command-documented">Why isn‚Äôt a particular command documented?</h2> <p>If it‚Äôs not in <code class="highlighter-rouge">man brew</code>, it‚Äôs probably an external command. These are documented <a href="external-commands">here</a>.</p> <h2 id="why-havent-you-pulled-my-pull-request">Why haven‚Äôt you pulled my pull request?</h2> <p>If it‚Äôs been a while, bump it with a ‚Äúbump‚Äù comment. Sometimes we miss requests and there are plenty of them. Maybe we were thinking on something. It will encourage consideration. In the meantime if you could rebase the pull request so that it can be cherry-picked more easily we will love you for a long time.</p> <h2 id="can-i-edit-formulae-myself">Can I edit formulae myself?</h2> <p>Yes! It‚Äôs easy! Just <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew edit &lt;formula&gt;</code>. You don‚Äôt have to submit modifications back to <code class="highlighter-rouge">homebrew/core</code>, just edit the formula as you personally need it and <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew install</code>. As a bonus <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew update</code> will merge your changes with upstream so you can still keep the formula up-to-date <strong>with</strong> your personal modifications!</p> <h2 id="can-i-make-new-formulae">Can I make new formulae?</h2> <p>Yes! It‚Äôs easy! Just <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew create URL</code>. Homebrew will then open the formula in <code class="highlighter-rouge">EDITOR</code> so you can edit it, but it probably already installs; try it: <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew
install &lt;formula&gt;</code>. If you encounter any issues, run the command with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">--debug</code> switch like so: <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew install --debug &lt;formula&gt;</code>, which drops you into a debugging shell.</p> <p>If you want your new formula to be part of <code class="highlighter-rouge">homebrew/core</code> or want to learn more about writing formulae, then please read the <a href="formula-cookbook">Formula Cookbook</a>.</p> <h2 id="can-i-install-my-own-stuff-to-usrlocal">Can I install my own stuff to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/local</code>?</h2> <p>Yes, <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew</code> is designed to not get in your way so you can use it how you like.</p> <p>Install your own stuff, but be aware that if you install common libraries like libexpat yourself, it may cause trouble when trying to build certain Homebrew formula. As a result <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew doctor</code> will warn you about this.</p> <p>Thus it‚Äôs probably better to install your own stuff to the Cellar and then <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew link</code> it. Like so:</p> <pre data-language="sh">$ cd foo-0.1
$ brew diy
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/foo/0.1
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/foo/0.1
[snip]
$ make &amp;&amp; make install
$ brew link foo
Linking /usr/local/Cellar/foo/0.1‚Ä¶ 17 symlinks created</pre> <h2 id="why-was-a-formula-deleted">Why was a formula deleted?</h2> <p>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew log &lt;formula&gt;</code> to find out! Likely because it had unresolved issues or our analytics identified it was not widely used.</p> <h2 id="homebrew-is-a-poor-name-its-too-generic-why-was-it-chosen">Homebrew is a poor name, it‚Äôs too generic, why was it chosen?</h2> <p>@mxcl was too concerned with the beer theme and didn‚Äôt consider that the project may actually prove popular. By the time he realised it was, it was too late. However, today, the first Google hit for ‚Äúhomebrew‚Äù is not beer related ;‚Äë)</p> <h2 id="what-does-keg-only-mean">What does ‚Äúkeg-only‚Äù mean?</h2> <p>It means the formula is installed only into the Cellar; it is not linked into <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/local</code>. This means most tools will not find it. We don‚Äôt do this for stupid reasons. You can still link in the formula if you need to with <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew link</code>.</p> <h2 id="how-can-i-specify-different-configure-arguments-for-a-formula">How can I specify different configure arguments for a formula?</h2> <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">brew edit &lt;formula&gt;</code> and edit the formula. Currently there is no other way to do this.</p> <h2 id="is-there-a-glossary-of-terms-around">Is there a glossary of terms around?</h2> <p>All your terminology needs can be <a href="formula-cookbook#homebrew-terminology">found here</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
