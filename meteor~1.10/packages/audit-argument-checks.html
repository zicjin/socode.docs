<p>This package causes Meteor to require that all arguments passed to methods and publish functions are <a href="#check">checked</a>. Any method that does not pass each one of its arguments to <code>check</code> will throw an error, which will be logged on the server and which will appear to the client as a <code>500 Internal server error</code>. This is a simple way to help ensure that your app has complete check coverage.</p> <p>Methods and publish functions that do not need to validate their arguments can simply run <code>check(arguments, [Match.Any])</code> to satisfy the <code>audit-argument-checks</code> coverage checker.</p><div class="_attribution">
