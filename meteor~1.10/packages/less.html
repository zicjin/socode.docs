<p><a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LESS</a> extends CSS with dynamic behavior such as variables, mixins, operations and functions. It allows for more compact stylesheets and helps reduce code duplication in CSS files.</p> <p>With the <code>less</code> package installed, <code>.less</code> files in your application are automatically compiled to CSS and the results are included in the client CSS bundle.</p> <blockquote> <p>If you want to <code>@import</code> a file, give it the extension <code>.import.less</code> to prevent Meteor from processing it independently.</p> </blockquote><div class="_attribution">
