<p>Most of the new features in Meteor 2.4 are either applied directly behind the scenes (in a backwards compatible manner) or are opt-in. For a complete breakdown of the changes, please refer to the <a href="http://docs.meteor.com/changelog.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changelog</a>.</p> <p>The above being said, there are a few items that you should implement to have easier time in the future.</p> <h3 id="createIndex">createIndex</h3> <p>Previously undocumented <code>_ensureIndex</code> has been aligned with MongoDB breaking change in naming and is now usable as <code>createIndex</code>. Use of <code>_ensureIndex</code> is now deprecated and will throw a warning in development for you.</p> <h3 id="email22">Email 2.2</h3> <p>The <code>email</code> package had a feature update. You can now override the sending functionality completely with <code>Email.customTransport</code> or if you are using <a href="https://nodemailer.com/smtp/well-known/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">known services</a> you can now ditch the <code>MAIL_URL</code> environment variable and set it in your <code>settings.json</code> file, like so:</p>  <pre class="line-numbers" style><code class="language-json">{
  "packages": {
    "email": {
      "service": "Mailgun",
      "user": "postmaster@meteor.com",
      "password": "superDuperPassword"
    }
  }
}
