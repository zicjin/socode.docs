<h1>bundle-format</h1>  <div class="sectionbody">  <p>The Git bundle format is a format that represents both refs and Git objects.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_format">Format</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>We will use ABNF notation to define the Git bundle format. See protocol-common.txt for the details.</p>   <p>A v2 bundle looks like this:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>bundle    = signature *prerequisite *reference LF pack
signature = "# v2 git bundle" LF

prerequisite = "-" obj-id SP comment LF
comment      = *CHAR
reference    = obj-id SP refname LF

pack         = ... ; packfile</pre> </div> </div>  <p>A v3 bundle looks like this:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>bundle    = signature *capability *prerequisite *reference LF pack
signature = "# v3 git bundle" LF

The objects stored in the bundle may refer to prerequisite objects and anything reachable from them (e.g. a tree object in the bundle can reference a blob that is reachable from a prerequisite) and/or expressed as a delta against prerequisite objects.</p> </li> <li> <p>"References" record the tips of the history graph, iow, what the reader of the bundle CAN "git fetch" from it.</p> </li> <li> <p>"Pack" is the pack data stream "git fetch" would send, if you fetch from a repository that has the references recorded in the "References" above into a repository that has references pointing at the objects listed in "Prerequisites" above.</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>In the bundle format, there can be a comment following a prerequisite obj-id. This is a comment and it has no specific meaning. The writer of the bundle MAY put any string here. The reader of the bundle MUST ignore the comment.</p>  <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_note_on_the_shallow_clone_and_a_git_bundle">
Note on the shallow clone and a Git bundle</h3>  <p>Note that the prerequisites does not represent a shallow-clone boundary. The semantics of the prerequisites and the shallow-clone boundaries are different, and the Git bundle v2 format cannot represent a shallow clone repository.</p>  </div> </div>   <h2 id="_capabilities">Capabilities</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Because there is no opportunity for negotiation, unknown capabilities cause <code>git bundle</code> to abort. The only known capability is <code>object-format</code>, which specifies the hash algorithm in use, and can take the same values as the <code>extensions.objectFormat</code> configuration value.</p>  </div><div class="_attribution">
