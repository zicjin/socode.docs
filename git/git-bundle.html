This includes checks on the bundle format itself as well as checking that the prerequisite commits exist and are fully linked in the current repository. <code>git bundle</code> prints a list of missing commits, if any, and exits with a non-zero status.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-bundle.txt-list-headsltfilegt"> list-heads &lt;file&gt; </dt> <dd> <p>Lists the references defined in the bundle.

For example, <code>master~10..master</code> causes the current master reference to be packaged along with all objects added since its 10th ancestor commit. There is no explicit limit to the number of references and objects that may be packaged.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-bundle.txt-ltrefnamegt82308203"> [&lt;refname&gt;…​] </dt> <dd> <p>A list of references used to limit the references reported as available. This is principally of use to <code>git fetch</code>, which expects to receive only those references asked for and not necessarily everything in the pack (in this case, <code>git bundle</code> acts like <code>git fetch-pack</code>).</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-bundle.txt---progress"> --progress </dt> <dd> <p>Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is specified.

The reason is that in some cases the output stream is directly linked to another command which may wish to display progress status of its own as it processes incoming pack data. This flag is like --progress except that it forces progress report for the write-out phase as well even if --stdout is used.</p> </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-bundle.txt---all-progress-implied"> --all-progress-implied </dt> <dd> <p>This is used to imply --all-progress whenever progress display is activated.

References such as <code>master~1</code> cannot be packaged, but are perfectly suitable for defining the basis. More than one reference may be packaged, and more than one basis can be specified. The objects packaged are those not contained in the union of the given bases. Each basis can be specified explicitly (e.g. <code>^master~10</code>), or implicitly (e.g. <code>master~10..master</code>, <code>--since=10.days.ago master</code>).</p>   <p>It is very important that the basis used be held by the destination. It is okay to err on the side of caution, causing the bundle file to contain objects already in the destination, as these are ignored when unpacking at the destination.</p>   <p><code>git clone</code> can use any bundle created without negative refspecs (e.g., <code>new</code>, but not <code>old..new</code>). If you want to match <code>git clone --mirror</code>, which would include your refs such as <code>refs/remotes/*</code>, use <code>--all</code>. If you want to provide the same set of refs that a clone directly from the source repository would get, use <code>--branches --tags</code> for the <code>&lt;git-rev-list-args&gt;</code>.</p>  </div>   <h2 id="_examples">Examples</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>Assume you want to transfer the history from a repository R1 on machine A to another repository R2 on machine B. For whatever reason, direct connection between A and B is not allowed, but we can move data from A to B via some mechanism (CD, email, etc.). We want to update R2 with development made on the branch master in R1.</p>   <p>To bootstrap the process, you can first create a bundle that does not have any basis. You can use a tag to remember up to what commit you last processed, in order to make it easy to later update the other repository with an incremental bundle:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>machineA$ cd R1
machineA$ git bundle create file.bundle master
machineA$ git tag -f lastR2bundle master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>Then you transfer file.bundle to the target machine B. Because this bundle does not require any existing object to be extracted, you can create a new repository on machine B by cloning from it:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>machineB$ git clone -b master /home/me/tmp/file.bundle R2</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This will define a remote called "origin" in the resulting repository that lets you fetch and pull from the bundle. The $GIT_DIR/config file in R2 will have an entry like this:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>[remote "origin"]
    url = /home/me/tmp/file.bundle
    fetch = refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</pre> </div> </div>  <p>To update the resulting mine.git repository, you can fetch or pull after replacing the bundle stored at /home/me/tmp/file.bundle with incremental updates.</p>   <p>After working some more in the original repository, you can create an incremental bundle to update the other repository:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>machineA$ cd R1
machineA$ git bundle create file.bundle lastR2bundle..master
machineA$ git tag -f lastR2bundle master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>You then transfer the bundle to the other machine to replace /home/me/tmp/file.bundle, and pull from it.</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>machineB$ cd R2
machineB$ git pull</pre> </div> </div>  <p>If you know up to what commit the intended recipient repository should have the necessary objects, you can use that knowledge to specify the basis, giving a cut-off point to limit the revisions and objects that go in the resulting bundle. The previous example used the lastR2bundle tag for this purpose, but you can use any other options that you would give to the <a href="git-log">git-log[1]</a> command. Here are more examples:</p>   <p>You can use a tag that is present in both:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bundle create mybundle v1.0.0..master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>You can use a basis based on time:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bundle create mybundle --since=10.days master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>You can use the number of commits:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bundle create mybundle -10 master</pre> </div> </div>  <p>You can run <code>git-bundle verify</code> to see if you can extract from a bundle that was created with a basis:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git bundle verify mybundle</pre> </div> </div>  <p>This will list what commits you must have in order to extract from the bundle and will error out if you do not have them.</p>   <p>A bundle from a recipient repository’s point of view is just like a regular repository which it fetches or pulls from. You can, for example, map references when fetching:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git fetch mybundle master:localRef</pre> </div> </div>  <p>You can also see what references it offers:</p>  <div class="listingblock"> <div class="content"> <pre data-language="shell-session">$ git ls-remote mybundle</pre> </div> </div> </div><div class="_attribution">
