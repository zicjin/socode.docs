This feature is intended to support working with legacy repositories containing such data.</p>  <p>Setting <code>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</code> will be picked up by <a href="git-fsck">git-fsck[1]</a>, but to accept pushes of such data set <code>receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</code> instead, or to clone or fetch it set <code>fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</code>.</p>   <p>The rest of the documentation discusses <code>fsck.*</code> for brevity, but the same applies for the corresponding <code>receive.fsck.*</code> and <code>fetch.&lt;msg-id&gt;.*</code>. variables.</p>   <p>Unlike variables like <code>color.ui</code> and <code>core.editor</code> the <code>receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</code> and <code>fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</code> variables will not fall back on the <code>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</code> configuration if they aren’t set. To uniformly configure the same fsck settings in different circumstances all three of them they must all set to the same values.</p>   <p>When <code>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</code> is set, errors can be switched to warnings and vice versa by configuring the <code>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</code> setting where the <code>&lt;msg-id&gt;</code> is the fsck message ID and the value is one of <code>error</code>, <code>warn</code> or <code>ignore</code>. For convenience, fsck prefixes the error/warning with the message ID, e.g. "missingEmail: invalid author/committer line - missing email" means that setting <code>fsck.missingEmail = ignore</code> will hide that issue.</p>   <p>In general, it is better to enumerate existing objects with problems with <code>fsck.skipList</code>, instead of listing the kind of breakages these problematic objects share to be ignored, as doing the latter will allow new instances of the same breakages go unnoticed.</p>   <p>Setting an unknown <code>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</code> value will cause fsck to die, but doing the same for <code>receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</code> and <code>fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</code> will only cause git to warn.</p>  </dd> <dt class="hdlist1" id="Documentation/git-fsck.txt-fsckskipList"> fsck.skipList </dt> <dd> <p>The path to a list of object names (i.e. one unabbreviated SHA-1 per line) that are known to be broken in a non-fatal way and should be ignored. On versions of Git 2.20 and later comments (<code>#</code>), empty lines, and any leading and trailing whitespace is ignored. Everything but a SHA-1 per line will error out on older versions.</p>  <p>This feature is useful when an established project should be accepted despite early commits containing errors that can be safely ignored such as invalid committer email addresses. Note: corrupt objects cannot be skipped with this setting.</p>   <p>Like <code>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</code> this variable has corresponding <code>receive.fsck.skipList</code> and <code>fetch.fsck.skipList</code> variants.</p>   <p>Unlike variables like <code>color.ui</code> and <code>core.editor</code> the <code>receive.fsck.skipList</code> and <code>fetch.fsck.skipList</code> variables will not fall back on the <code>fsck.skipList</code> configuration if they aren’t set. To uniformly configure the same fsck settings in different circumstances all three of them they must all set to the same values.</p>   <p>Older versions of Git (before 2.20) documented that the object names list should be sorted. This was never a requirement, the object names could appear in any order, but when reading the list we tracked whether the list was sorted for the purposes of an internal binary search implementation, which could save itself some work with an already sorted list. Unless you had a humongous list there was no reason to go out of your way to pre-sort the list. After Git version 2.20 a hash implementation is used instead, so there’s now no reason to pre-sort the list.</p>  </dd> </dl> </div> </div>   <h2 id="_discussion">Discussion</h2> <div class="sectionbody">  <p>git-fsck tests SHA-1 and general object sanity, and it does full tracking of the resulting reachability and everything else.
