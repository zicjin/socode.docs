Size encoding</h3>  <p>This document uses the following "size encoding" of non-negative integers: From each byte, the seven least significant bits are used to form the resulting integer. As long as the most significant bit is 1, this process continues; the byte with MSB 0 provides the last seven bits. The seven-bit chunks are concatenated. Later values are more significant.</p>   <p>This size encoding should not be confused with the "offset encoding", which is also used in this document.</p>  </div> <div class="sect2"> <h3 id="_deltified_representation">
Deltified representation</h3>  <p>Conceptually there are only four object types: commit, tree, tag and blob. However to save space, an object could be stored as a "delta" of another "base" object. These representations are assigned new types ofs-delta and ref-delta, which is only valid in a pack file.</p>   <p>Both ofs-delta and ref-delta store the "delta" to be applied to another object (called <code>base object</code>) to reconstruct the object. The difference between them is, ref-delta directly encodes base object name. If the base object is in the same pack, ofs-delta encodes the offset of the base object in the pack instead.</p>   <p>The base object could also be deltified if it’s in the same pack. Ref-delta can also refer to an object outside the pack (i.e. the so-called "thin pack"). When stored on disk however, the pack should be self contained to avoid cyclic dependency.</p>   <p>The delta data starts with the size of the base object and the size of the object to be reconstructed. These sizes are encoded using the size encoding from above. The remainder of the delta data is a sequence of instructions to reconstruct the object from the base object. If the base object is deltified, it must be converted to canonical form first. Each instruction appends more and more data to the target object until it’s complete. There are two supported instructions so far: one for copy a byte range from the source object and one for inserting new data embedded in the instruction itself.</p>   <p>Each instruction has variable length. Instruction type is determined by the seventh bit of the first octet. The following diagrams follow the convention in RFC 1951 (Deflate compressed data format).</p>  <div class="sect3"> <h4 id="_instruction_to_copy_from_base_object">

Each bit needs to correspond to an object in the MIDX, and so we need an efficient mapping from bit position to MIDX position.</p>   <p>One solution is to let bits occupy the same position in the oid-sorted index stored by the MIDX. But because oids are effectively random, their resulting reachability bitmaps would have no locality, and thus compress poorly. (This is the reason that single-pack bitmaps use the pack ordering, and not the .idx ordering, for the same purpose.)</p>   <p>So we’d like to define an ordering for the whole MIDX based around pack ordering, which has far better locality (and thus compresses more efficiently). We can think of a pseudo-pack created by the concatenation of all of the packs in the MIDX. E.g., if we had a MIDX with three packs (a, b, c), with 10, 15, and 20 objects respectively, we can imagine an ordering of the objects like:</p>  <div class="literalblock"> <div class="content"> <pre>|a,0|a,1|...|a,9|b,0|b,1|...|b,14|c,0|c,1|...|c,19|</pre> </div> </div>  <p>where the ordering of the packs is defined by the MIDX’s pack list, and then the ordering of objects within each pack is the same as the order in the actual packfile.</p>   <p>Given the list of packs and their counts of objects, you can naïvely reconstruct that pseudo-pack ordering (e.g., the object at position 27 must be (c,1) because packs "a" and "b" consumed 25 of the slots). But there’s a catch. Objects may be duplicated between packs, in which case the MIDX only stores one pointer to the object (and thus we’d want only one slot in the bitmap).</p>   <p>Callers could handle duplicates themselves by reading objects in order of their bit-position, but that’s linear in the number of objects, and much too expensive for ordinary bitmap lookups. Building a reverse index solves this, since it is the logical inverse of the index, and that index has already removed duplicates. But, building a reverse index on the fly can be expensive. Since we already have an on-disk format for pack-based reverse indexes, let’s reuse it for the MIDX’s pseudo-pack, too.</p>   <p>Objects from the MIDX are ordered as follows to string together the pseudo-pack. Let <code>pack(o)</code> return the pack from which <code>o</code> was selected by the MIDX, and define an ordering of packs based on their numeric ID (as stored by the MIDX). Let <code>offset(o)</code> return the object offset of <code>o</code> within <code>pack(o)</code>. Then, compare <code>o1</code> and <code>o2</code> as follows:</p>  <div class="ulist"> <ul> <li> <p>If one of <code>pack(o1)</code> and <code>pack(o2)</code> is preferred and the other is not, then the preferred one sorts first.</p>  <p>(This is a detail that allows the MIDX bitmap to determine which pack should be used by the pack-reuse mechanism, since it can ask the MIDX for the pack containing the object at bit position 0).</p>  </li> <li> <p>If <code>pack(o1) ≠ pack(o2)</code>, then sort the two objects in descending order based on the pack ID.</p> </li> <li> <p>Otherwise, <code>pack(o1) = pack(o2)</code>, and the objects are sorted in pack-order (i.e., <code>o1</code> sorts ahead of <code>o2</code> exactly when <code>offset(o1)
&lt; offset(o2)</code>).</p> </li> </ul> </div>  <p>In short, a MIDX’s pseudo-pack is the de-duplicated concatenation of objects in packs stored by the MIDX, laid out in pack order, and the packs arranged in MIDX order (with the preferred pack coming first).</p>   <p>The MIDX’s reverse index is stored in the optional <code>RIDX</code> chunk within the MIDX itself.</p>  </div><div class="_attribution">
