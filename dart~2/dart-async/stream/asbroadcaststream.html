It is possible to pause, resume or cancel the subscription during the call to <code>onListen</code>. It is not possible to change the event handlers, including using <a href="../streamsubscription/asfuture">StreamSubscription.asFuture</a>.</p> <p>If <code>onCancel</code> is provided, it is called in a similar way to <code>onListen</code> when the returned stream stops having listener. If it later gets a new listener, the <code>onListen</code> function is called again.</p> <p>Use the callbacks, for example, for pausing the underlying subscription while having no subscribers to prevent losing events, or canceling the subscription when there are no listeners.</p> <p>Cancelling is intended to be used when there are no current subscribers. If the subscription passed to <code>onListen</code> or <code>onCancel</code> is cancelled, then no further events are ever emitted by current subscriptions on the returned broadcast stream, not even a done event.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">Stream&lt;T&gt; asBroadcastStream(
