Hence fields are not included, but the getters and setters implicitly introduced by fields are included. The map includes methods, getters and setters that are inherited as well as those introduced by the class itself.</p> <p>The map is keyed by the simple names of the members.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">Map&lt;Symbol, MethodMirror&gt; get instanceMembers;</pre><div class="_attribution">
