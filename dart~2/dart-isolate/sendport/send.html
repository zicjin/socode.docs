<li>
<a href="../../dart-core/object-class">Object</a>? message</li> </ol>) </wbr></section>  <p>Sends an asynchronous <code>message</code> through this send port, to its corresponding <code>ReceivePort</code>.</p> <p>The content of <code>message</code> can be: primitive values (null, num, bool, double, String), instances of <a href="../sendport-class">SendPort</a>, and lists and maps whose elements are any of these. List and maps are also allowed to contain cyclic references.</p> <p>In the special circumstances when two isolates share the same code and are running in the same process (e.g. isolates created via <a href="../isolate/spawn">Isolate.spawn</a>), it is also possible to send object instances (which would be copied in the process). This is currently only supported by the <a href="https://dart.dev/platforms#dart-native-vm-jit-and-aot">Dart Native</a> platform.</p> <p>The send happens immediately and doesn't block. The corresponding receive port can receive the message as soon as its isolate's event loop is ready to deliver it, independently of what the sending isolate is doing.</p>   <h2 id="source">Implementation</h2> <pre class="language-dart" data-language="dart">void send(Object? message);</pre><div class="_attribution">
