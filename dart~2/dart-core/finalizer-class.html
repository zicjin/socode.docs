/// Access the database.

  // *and* closes connection if the user forgets to.
  var connection = _connectToDatabase();

}</pre> <p>This example has an example of an external resource that needs clean-up. The finalizer is used to clean up an external connection when the user of the API no longer has access to that connection. The example uses the same object as attached object and detach key, which is a useful approach when each attached object can be detached individually. Being a detachment key doesn't keep an object alive.</p> <p>No promises are made that the callback will ever be called. The only thing that is guaranteed is that if a finalizer's callback is called with a specific finalization token as argument, then at least one value with an attachment to to the finalizer that has that finalization token, is no longer accessible to the program.</p> <p>If the finalzier <em>itself</em> becomes unreachable, it's allowed to be garbage collected and then it won't trigger any further callbacks. Always make sure to keep the finalizer itself reachable while it's needed.</p> <p>If multiple finalizers are attached to a single object, or the same finalizer is attached multiple times to an object, and that object becomes inaccessible to the program, then any number (including zero) of those attachments may trigger their associated finalizer's callback. It will not necessarily be all or none of them.</p> <p>Finalization callbacks will happen as <em>events</em>. They will not happen during execution of other code, and not as a microtask, but as high-level events similar to timer events.</p> <p>Finalization callbacks must not throw.</p>   <dl class="dl-horizontal"> <dt>Annotations</dt> <dd> <ul class="annotation-list clazz-relationships"> <li>@Since("2.17")</li> </ul> </dd> </dl>   <h2 id="constructors">Constructors</h2> <dl class="constructor-summary-list"> <dt id="Finalizer"> <a href="finalizer/finalizer">Finalizer</a>(void callback(T)) <div class="constructor-modifier features">factory</div>
