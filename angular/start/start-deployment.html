  <h1 id="deploying-an-application">Deploying an application</h1> <p>Deploying your application is the process of compiling, or building, your code and hosting the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML on a web server.</p> <p>This section builds on the previous steps in the <a href="https://angular.io/start/start" title="Try it: A basic application">Getting Started</a> tutorial and shows you how to deploy your application.</p> <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2> <p>A best practice is to run your project locally before you deploy it. To run your project locally, you need the following installed on your computer:</p> <ul> <li> <p><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <a href="https://cli.angular.io/">Angular CLI</a>. From the terminal, install the Angular CLI globally with:</p> <pre data-language="sh">npm install -g @angular/cli</pre> <p> With the Angular CLI, you can use the command <code>ng</code> to create new workspaces, new projects, serve your application during development, or produce builds to share or distribute.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="running-your-application-locally">Running your application locally</h2> <ol> <li> <p>Download the source code from your StackBlitz project by clicking the <code>Download Project</code> icon in the left menu, across from <code>Project</code>, to download your files.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a new Angular CLI workspace using the <a href="https://angular.io/start/cli/new" title="CLI ng new command reference"><code>ng new</code></a> command, where <code>my-project-name</code> is what you would like to call your project:</p> <pre data-language="sh">ng new my-project-name</pre> <p>This command displays a series of configuration prompts. For this tutorial, accept the default settings for each prompt.</p> </li> <li> <p>In your newly CLI-generated application, replace the <code>/src</code> folder with the <code>/src</code> folder from your <code>StackBlitz</code> download.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the following CLI command to run your application locally:</p> <pre data-language="sh">ng serve</pre> </li> <li> <p>To see your application in the browser, go to http://localhost:4200/. If the default port 4200 is not available, you can specify another port with the port flag as in the following example:</p> <pre data-language="sh">ng serve --port 4201</pre> <p>While serving your application, you can edit your code and see the changes update automatically in the browser. To stop the <code>ng serve</code> command, press <code>Ctrl</code>+<code>c</code>.</p> </li> </ol>  <h2 id="building-and-hosting-your-application">Building and hosting your application</h2> <ol> <li> <p>To build your application for production, use the <code>build</code> command. By default, this command uses the <code>production</code> build configuration.</p> <pre data-language="sh">ng build</pre> <p>This command creates a <code>dist</code> folder in the application root directory with all the files that a hosting service needs for serving your application.</p> <blockquote class="alert is-helpful"> <p>If the above <code>ng build</code> command throws an error about missing packages, append the missing dependencies in your local project's <code>package.json</code> file to match the one in the downloaded StackBlitz project.</p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p>Copy the contents of the <code>dist/my-project-name</code> folder to your web server. Because these files are static, you can host them on any web server capable of serving files; such as <code>Node.js</code>, Java, .NET, or any backend such as <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting">Firebase</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/web-hosting">Google Cloud</a>, or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/getting-started/hosting-a-static-website">App Engine</a>.
