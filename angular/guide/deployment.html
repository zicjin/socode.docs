  <h1 id="deployment">Deployment</h1> <p>When you are ready to deploy your Angular application to a remote server, you have various options for deployment.</p>   <h2 id="simple-deployment-options">Simple deployment options</h2> <p>Before fully deploying your application, you can test the process, build configuration, and deployed behavior by using one of these interim techniques.</p> <h3 id="building-and-serving-from-disk">Building and serving from disk</h3> <p>During development, you typically use the <code>ng serve</code> command to build, watch, and serve the application from local memory, using <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#webpack-dev-server">webpack-dev-server</a>. When you are ready to deploy, however, you must use the <code>ng build</code> command to build the application and deploy the build artifacts elsewhere.</p> <p>Both <code>ng build</code> and <code>ng serve</code> clear the output folder before they build the project, but only the <code>ng build</code> command writes the generated build artifacts to the output folder.</p> <blockquote class="alert is-helpful"> <p>The output folder is <code>dist/project-name/</code> by default. To output to a different folder, change the <code>outputPath</code> in <code>angular.json</code>.</p> </blockquote> <p>As you near the end of the development process, serving the contents of your output folder from a local web server can give you a better idea of how your application will behave when it is deployed to a remote server. You will need two terminals to get the live-reload experience.</p> <ul> <li> <p>On the first terminal, run the <a href="cli/build"><code>ng build</code> command</a> in <em>watch</em> mode to compile the application to the <code>dist</code> folder.</p> <pre data-language="sh">ng build --watch</pre> <p>Like the <code>ng serve</code> command, this regenerates output files when source files change.</p> </li> <li> <p>On the second terminal, install a web server (such as <a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server">lite-server</a>), and run it against the output folder. For example:</p> <pre data-language="sh">lite-server --baseDir="dist/project-name"</pre> <p> The server will automatically reload your browser when new files are output.</p> </li> </ul> <blockquote class="alert is-critical"> <p>This method is for development and testing only, and is not a supported or secure way of deploying an application.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="automatic-deployment-with-the-cli">Automatic deployment with the CLI</h3> <p>The Angular CLI command <code>ng deploy</code> (introduced in version 8.3.0) executes the <code>deploy</code> <a href="cli-builder">CLI builder</a> associated with your project. A number of third-party builders implement deployment capabilities to different platforms. You can add any of them to your project by running <code>ng add [package name]</code>.</p> <p>When you add a package with deployment capability, it'll automatically update your workspace configuration (<code>angular.json</code> file) with a <code>deploy</code> section for the selected project. You can then use the <code>ng deploy</code> command to deploy that project.</p> <p>For example, the following command automatically deploys a project to Firebase.</p> <pre data-language="sh">ng add @angular/fire
ng deploy</pre> <p>The command is interactive. In this case, you must have or create a Firebase account, and authenticate using that account. The command prompts you to select a Firebase project for deployment</p> <p>The command builds your application and uploads the production assets to Firebase.</p> <p>In the table below, you can find a list of packages which implement deployment functionality to different platforms.

</h3> <p>Angular applications are perfect candidates for serving with a simple static HTML server. You don't need a server-side engine to dynamically compose application pages because Angular does that on the client-side.</p> <p>If the application uses the Angular router, you must configure the server to return the application's host page (<code>index.html</code>) when asked for a file that it does not have.</p>  <p>A routed application should support "deep links". A <em>deep link</em> is a URL that specifies a path to a component inside the application. For example, <code>http://www.mysite.com/heroes/42</code> is a <em>deep link</em> to the hero detail page that displays the hero with <code>id: 42</code>.</p> <p>There is no issue when the user navigates to that URL from within a running client. The Angular router interprets the URL and routes to that page and hero.</p> <p>But clicking a link in an email, entering it in the browser address bar, or merely refreshing the browser while on the hero detail page — all of these actions are handled by the browser itself, <em>outside</em> the running application. The browser makes a direct request to the server for that URL, bypassing the router.</p> <p>A static server routinely returns <code>index.html</code> when it receives a request for <code>http://www.mysite.com/</code>. But it rejects <code>http://www.mysite.com/heroes/42</code> and returns a <code>404 - Not Found</code> error <em>unless</em> it is configured to return <code>index.html</code> instead.</p> <h4 id="fallback-configuration-examples">Fallback configuration examples</h4> <p>There is no single configuration that works for every server.

Because lazy-loaded modules aren't imported in JavaScript, bundlers exclude them by default. Bundlers don't know about the router configuration and can't create separate bundles for lazy-loaded modules. You would have to create these bundles manually.</p> <p>The CLI runs the <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/tree/master/packages/ngtools/webpack">Angular Ahead-of-Time Webpack Plugin</a> which automatically recognizes lazy-loaded <code>NgModules</code> and creates separate bundles for them.</p> </div>  <h3 id="measure-performance">Measure performance</h3> <p>You can make better decisions about what to optimize and how when you have a clear and accurate understanding of what's making the application slow.

a base path for resolving relative URLs to assets such as images, scripts, and style sheets. For example, given the <code>&lt;base href="/my/app/"&gt;</code>, the browser resolves a URL such as <code>some/place/foo.jpg</code> into a server request for <code>my/app/some/place/foo.jpg</code>. During navigation, the Angular router uses the <em>base href</em> as the base path to component, template, and module files.</p> <blockquote class="alert is-helpful"> <p>See also the <a href="../api/common/app_base_href" title="API: APP_BASE_HREF"><em>APP_BASE_HREF</em></a> alternative.</p> </blockquote> <p>In development, you typically start the server in the folder that holds <code>index.html</code>. That's the root folder and you'd add <code>&lt;base href="/"&gt;</code> near the top of <code>index.html</code> because <code>/</code> is the root of the application.</p> <p>But on the shared or production server, you might serve the application from a subfolder. For example, when the URL to load the application is something like <code>http://www.mysite.com/my/app/</code>, the subfolder is <code>my/app/</code> and you should add <code>&lt;base href="/my/app/"&gt;</code> to the server version of the <code>index.html</code>.</p> <p>When the <code>base</code> tag is mis-configured, the application fails to load and the browser console displays <code>404 - Not Found</code> errors for the missing files. Look at where it <em>tried</em> to find those files and adjust the base tag appropriately.</p>  <h2 id="the-deploy-url">The <code>deploy</code> url</h2> <p>A command line option used to specify the base path for resolving relative URLs for assets such as images, scripts, and style sheets at <em>compile</em> time. For example: <code>ng build --deploy-url /my/assets</code>.</p> <p>The effects of defining a <code>deploy url</code> and <code>base href</code> can overlap.</p> <ul> <li>Both can be used for initial scripts, stylesheets, lazy scripts, and css resources.</li> </ul> <p>However, defining a <code>base href</code> has a few unique effects.</p> <ul> <li>Defining a <code>base href</code> can be used for locating relative template (HTML) assets, and relative fetch/XMLHttpRequests.</li> </ul> <p>The <code>base href</code> can also be used to define the Angular router's default base (see <a href="../api/common/app_base_href">APP_BASE_HREF</a>). Users with more complicated setups may need to manually configure the <code><a href="../api/common/app_base_href" class="code-anchor">APP_BASE_HREF</a></code> token within the application. (e.g., application routing base is / but assets/scripts/etc. are at /assets/).</p> <p>Unlike the <code>base href</code> which can be defined in a single place, the <code>deploy url</code> needs to be hard-coded into an application at build time. This means specifying a <code>deploy url</code> will decrease build speed, but this is the unfortunate cost of using an option that embeds itself throughout an application. That is why a <code>base href</code> is generally the better option.</p><div class="_attribution">
