  <h1 id="deployment">Deployment</h1> <p>When you are ready to deploy your Angular application to a remote server, you have various options for deployment.</p>   <h2 id="simple-deployment-options">Simple deployment options</h2> <p>Before fully deploying your application, you can test the process, build configuration, and deployed behavior by using one of these interim techniques.</p> <h3 id="building-and-serving-from-disk">Building and serving from disk</h3> <p>During development, you typically use the <code>ng serve</code> command to build, watch, and serve the application from local memory, using <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#webpack-dev-server">webpack-dev-server</a>. When you are ready to deploy, however, you must use the <code>ng build</code> command to build the application and deploy the build artifacts elsewhere.</p> <p>Both <code>ng build</code> and <code>ng serve</code> clear the output folder before they build the project, but only the <code>ng build</code> command writes the generated build artifacts to the output folder.</p> <blockquote class="alert is-helpful"> <p>The output folder is <code>dist/project-name/</code> by default. To output to a different folder, change the <code>outputPath</code> in <code>angular.json</code>.</p> </blockquote> <p>As you near the end of the development process, serving the contents of your output folder from a local web server can give you a better idea of how your application will behave when it is deployed to a remote server. You will need two terminals to get the live-reload experience.</p> <ul> <li> <p>On the first terminal, run the <a href="cli/build"><code>ng build</code> command</a> in <em>watch</em> mode to compile the application to the <code>dist</code> folder.</p> <pre data-language="sh">ng build --watch</pre> <p>Like the <code>ng serve</code> command, this regenerates output files when source files change.</p> </li> <li> <p>On the second terminal, install a web server (such as <a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server">lite-server</a>), and run it against the output folder. For example:</p> <pre data-language="sh">lite-server --baseDir="dist/project-name"</pre> <p> The server will automatically reload your browser when new files are output.</p> </li> </ul> <blockquote class="alert is-critical"> <p>This method is for development and testing only, and is not a supported or secure way of deploying an application.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="automatic-deployment-with-the-cli">Automatic deployment with the CLI</h3> <p>The Angular CLI command <code>ng deploy</code> (introduced in version 8.3.0) executes the <code>deploy</code> <a href="cli-builder">CLI builder</a> associated with your project. A number of third-party builders implement deployment capabilities to different platforms. You can add any of them to your project by running <code>ng add [package name]</code>.</p> <p>When you add a package with deployment capability, it'll automatically update your workspace configuration (<code>angular.json</code> file) with a <code>deploy</code> section for the selected project. You can then use the <code>ng deploy</code> command to deploy that project.</p> <p>For example, the following command automatically deploys a project to Firebase.</p> <pre data-language="sh">ng add @angular/fire
ng deploy</pre> <p>The command is interactive. In this case, you must have or create a Firebase account, and authenticate using that account. The command prompts you to select a Firebase project for deployment</p> <p>The command builds your application and uploads the production assets to Firebase.</p> <p>In the table below, you can find a list of packages which implement deployment functionality to different platforms.

</h3> <p>Angular applications are perfect candidates for serving with a simple static HTML server. You don't need a server-side engine to dynamically compose application pages because Angular does that on the client-side.</p> <p>If the application uses the Angular router, you must configure the server to return the application's host page (<code>index.html</code>) when asked for a file that it does not have.</p>  <p>A routed application should support "deep links". A <em>deep link</em> is a URL that specifies a path to a component inside the application. For example, <code>http://www.mysite.com/heroes/42</code> is a <em>deep link</em> to the hero detail page that displays the hero with <code>id: 42</code>.</p> <p>There is no issue when the user navigates to that URL from within a running client. The Angular router interprets the URL and routes to that page and hero.</p> <p>But clicking a link in an email, entering it in the browser address bar, or merely refreshing the browser while on the hero detail page — all of these actions are handled by the browser itself, <em>outside</em> the running application. The browser makes a direct request to the server for that URL, bypassing the router.</p> <p>A static server routinely returns <code>index.html</code> when it receives a request for <code>http://www.mysite.com/</code>. But it rejects <code>http://www.mysite.com/heroes/42</code> and returns a <code>404 - Not Found</code> error <em>unless</em> it is configured to return <code>index.html</code> instead.</p> <h4 id="fallback-configuration-examples">Fallback configuration examples</h4> <p>There is no single configuration that works for every server.

Because lazy-loaded modules aren't imported in JavaScript, bundlers exclude them by default. Bundlers don't know about the router configuration and can't create separate bundles for lazy-loaded modules. You would have to create these bundles manually.</p> <p>The CLI runs the <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/tree/master/packages/ngtools/webpack">Angular Ahead-of-Time Webpack Plugin</a> which automatically recognizes lazy-loaded <code>NgModules</code> and creates separate bundles for them.</p> </div>  <h3 id="measure-performance">Measure performance</h3> <p>You can make better decisions about what to optimize and how when you have a clear and accurate understanding of what's making the application slow.

alt="quickstart sourcemap explorer" width="767" height="401"> </div>  <h2 id="the-base-tag">The <code>base</code> tag</h2> <p>The HTML <a href="router"><em>&lt;base href="..."/&gt;</em></a> specifies a base path for resolving relative URLs to assets such as images, scripts, and style sheets. For example, given the <code>&lt;base href="/my/app/"&gt;</code>, the browser resolves a URL such as <code>some/place/foo.jpg</code> into a server request for <code>my/app/some/place/foo.jpg</code>. During navigation, the Angular router uses the <em>base href</em> as the base path to component, template, and module files.</p> <blockquote class="alert is-helpful"> <p>See also the <a href="../api/common/app_base_href" title="API: APP_BASE_HREF"><em>APP_BASE_HREF</em></a> alternative.</p> </blockquote> <p>In development, you typically start the server in the folder that holds <code>index.html</code>. That's the root folder and you'd add <code>&lt;base href="/"&gt;</code> near the top of <code>index.html</code> because <code>/</code> is the root of the application.</p> <p>But on the shared or production server, you might serve the application from a subfolder. For example, when the URL to load the application is something like <code>http://www.mysite.com/my/app/</code>, the subfolder is <code>my/app/</code> and you should add <code>&lt;base href="/my/app/"&gt;</code> to the server version of the <code>index.html</code>.</p> <p>When the <code>base</code> tag is mis-configured, the application fails to load and the browser console displays <code>404 - Not Found</code> errors for the missing files. Look at where it <em>tried</em> to find those files and adjust the base tag appropriately.</p>  <h2 id="the-deploy-url">The <code>deploy</code> url</h2> <p>A command line option used to specify the base path for resolving relative URLs for assets such as images, scripts, and style sheets at <em>compile</em> time. For example: <code>ng build --deploy-url /my/assets</code>.</p> <p>The effects of defining a <code>deploy url</code> and <code>base href</code> can overlap.</p> <ul> <li>Both can be used for initial scripts, stylesheets, lazy scripts, and css resources.</li> </ul> <p>However, defining a <code>base href</code> has a few unique effects.</p> <ul> <li>Defining a <code>base href</code> can be used for locating relative template (HTML) assets, and relative fetch/XMLHttpRequests.</li> </ul> <p>The <code>base href</code> can also be used to define the Angular router's default base (see <a href="../api/common/app_base_href">APP_BASE_HREF</a>). Users with more complicated setups may need to manually configure the <code><a href="../api/common/app_base_href" class="code-anchor">APP_BASE_HREF</a></code> token within the application. (e.g., application routing base is / but assets/scripts/etc. are at /assets/).</p> <p>Unlike the <code>base href</code> which can be defined in a single place, the <code>deploy url</code> needs to be hard-coded into an application at build time. This means specifying a <code>deploy url</code> will decrease build speed, but this is the unfortunate cost of using an option that embeds itself throughout an application. That is why a <code>base href</code> is generally the better option.</p>  <h2 id="differential-loading">Differential Loading</h2> <p>When building web applications, you want to make sure your application is compatible with the majority of browsers. Even as JavaScript continues to evolve, with new features being introduced, not all browsers are updated with support for these new features at the same pace.</p> <p>The code you write in development using TypeScript is compiled and bundled into ES2015, the JavaScript syntax that is compatible with most browsers. All modern browsers support ES2015 and beyond, but in most cases, you still have to account for users accessing your application from a browser that doesn't. When targeting older browsers, <a href="browser-support#polyfills">polyfills</a> can bridge the gap by providing functionality that doesn't exist in the older versions of JavaScript supported by those browsers.</p> <p>To maximize compatibility, you could ship a single bundle that includes all your compiled code, plus any polyfills that may be needed. Users with modern browsers, however, shouldn't have to pay the price of increased bundle size that comes with polyfills they don't need. Differential loading, which is supported in Angular CLI version 8 and higher, can help solve this problem.</p> <p>Differential loading is a strategy that allows your web application to support multiple browsers, but only load the necessary code that the browser needs. When differential loading is enabled the CLI builds two separate bundles as part of your deployed application.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The first bundle contains modern ES2015 syntax. This bundle takes advantage of built-in support in modern browsers, ships fewer polyfills, and results in a smaller bundle size.</p> </li> <li> <p>The second bundle contains code in the old ES5 syntax, along with all necessary polyfills. This second bundle is larger, but supports older browsers.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="differential-builds">Differential builds</h3> <p>When you deploy using the Angular CLI build process, you can choose how and when to support differential loading. The <a href="cli/build"><code>ng build</code> CLI command</a> queries the browser configuration and the configured build target to determine if support for legacy browsers is required, and whether the build should produce the necessary bundles used for differential loading.</p> <p>The following configurations determine your requirements.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Browserslist</p> <p> The Browserslist configuration file is included in your application <a href="file-structure#application-configuration-files">project structure</a> and provides the minimum browsers your application supports. See the <a href="https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist">Browserslist spec</a> for complete configuration options.</p> </li> <li> <p>TypeScript configuration</p> <p> In the TypeScript configuration file, the "target" option in the <code>compilerOptions</code> section determines the ECMAScript target version that the code is compiled to. Modern browsers support ES2015 natively, while ES5 is more commonly used to support legacy browsers.</p> </li> </ul> <blockquote class="alert is-helpful"> <p> Differential loading is currently only supported when using <code>es2015</code> as a compilation target. When used with targets higher than <code>es2015</code>, the build process emits a warning.</p> </blockquote> <p>For a development build, the output produced by <code>ng build</code> is simpler and easier to debug, allowing you to rely less on sourcemaps of compiled code.</p> <p>For a production build, your configuration determines which bundles are created for deployment of your application. When needed, the <code>index.html</code> file is also modified during the build process to include script tags that enable differential loading, as shown in the following example.</p> <pre header="index.html" data-language="html">&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;app-root&gt;&lt;/app-root&gt;
  &lt;script src="runtime-es2015.js" type="module"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src="runtime-es5.js" nomodule&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src="polyfills-es2015.js" type="module"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src="polyfills-es5.js" nomodule&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src="styles-es2015.js" type="module"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src="styles-es5.js" nomodule&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src="vendor-es2015.js" type="module"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src="vendor-es5.js" nomodule&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src="main-es2015.js" type="module"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src="main-es5.js" nomodule&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</pre> <p>Each script tag has a <code>type="module"</code> or <code>nomodule</code> attribute. Browsers with native support for ES modules only load the scripts with the <code>module</code> type attribute and ignore scripts with the <code>nomodule</code> attribute. Legacy browsers only load the scripts with the <code>nomodule</code> attribute, and ignore the script tags with the <code>module</code> type that load ES modules.</p> <blockquote class="alert is-helpful"> <p> Some legacy browsers still download both bundles, but only execute the appropriate scripts based on the attributes mentioned above. You can read more on the issue <a href="https://github.com/philipwalton/webpack-esnext-boilerplate/issues/1">here</a>.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="configuring-differential-loading">Configuring differential loading</h3> <p>To include differential loading in your application builds, you must configure the Browserslist and TypeScript configuration files in your application project.</p> <p>The following examples show a <code>.browserslistrc</code> and <code>tsconfig.json</code> file for a newly created Angular application. In this configuration, legacy browsers such as IE 9-11 are ignored, and the compilation target is ES2015.</p> <pre header=".browserslistrc" data-language="none"># This file is used by the build system to adjust CSS and JS output to support the specified browsers below.
