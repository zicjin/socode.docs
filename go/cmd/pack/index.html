<h1> Command pack  </h1>  <p> Pack is a simple version of the traditional Unix ar tool. It implements only the operations needed by Go. </p> <p> Usage: </p> <pre data-language="go">go tool pack op file.a [name...]
</pre> <p> Pack applies the operation to the archive, using the names as arguments to the operation. </p> <p> The operation op is given by one of these letters: </p> <pre data-language="go">c	append files (from the file system) to a new archive
p	print files from the archive
r	append files (from the file system) to the archive
t	list files from the archive
x	extract files from the archive
</pre> <p> The archive argument to the c command must be non-existent or a valid archive file, which will be cleared before adding new entries. It is an error if the file exists but is not an archive. </p> <p> For the p, t, and x commands, listing no names on the command line causes the operation to apply to all files in the archive. </p> <p> In contrast to Unix ar, the r operation always appends to the archive, even if a file with the given name already exists in the archive. In this way pack's r operation is more like Unix ar's rq operation. </p> <p> Adding the letter v to an operation, as in pv or rv, enables verbose operation: For the c and r commands, names are printed as files are added. For the p command, each file is prefixed by the name on a line by itself. For the t command, the listing includes additional file metadata. For the x command, names are printed as files are extracted. </p><div class="_attribution">
