<h1> Command cover  </h1>  <p> Cover is a program for analyzing the coverage profiles generated by 'go test -coverprofile=cover.out'. </p> <p> Cover is also used by 'go test -cover' to rewrite the source code with annotations to track which parts of each function are executed. It operates on one Go source file at a time, computing approximate basic block information by studying the source. It is thus more portable than binary-rewriting coverage tools, but also a little less capable. For instance, it does not probe inside &amp;&amp; and || expressions, and can be mildly confused by single statements with multiple function literals. </p> <p> When computing coverage of a package that uses cgo, the cover tool must be applied to the output of cgo preprocessing, not the input, because cover deletes comments that are significant to cgo. </p> <p> For usage information, please see: </p> <pre data-language="go">go help testflag
