<h1> Command addr2line  </h1>  <p> Addr2line is a minimal simulation of the GNU addr2line tool, just enough to support pprof. </p> <p> Usage: </p> <pre data-language="go">go tool addr2line binary
</pre> <p> Addr2line reads hexadecimal addresses, one per line and with optional 0x prefix, from standard input. For each input address, addr2line prints two output lines, first the name of the function containing the address and second the file:line of the source code corresponding to that address. </p> <p> This tool is intended for use only by pprof; its interface may change or it may be deleted entirely in future releases. </p><div class="_attribution">
