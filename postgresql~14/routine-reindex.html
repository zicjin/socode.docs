<h1>25.2. Routine Reindexing</h1>    <p>In some situations it is worthwhile to rebuild indexes periodically with the <a class="xref" href="sql-reindex" title="REINDEX">REINDEX</a> command or a series of individual rebuilding steps.</p> <p>B-tree index pages that have become completely empty are reclaimed for re-use. However, there is still a possibility of inefficient use of space: if all but a few index keys on a page have been deleted, the page remains allocated. Therefore, a usage pattern in which most, but not all, keys in each range are eventually deleted will see poor use of space. For such usage patterns, periodic reindexing is recommended.</p> <p>The potential for bloat in non-B-tree indexes has not been well researched. It is a good idea to periodically monitor the index's physical size when using any non-B-tree index type.</p> <p>Also, for B-tree indexes, a freshly-constructed index is slightly faster to access than one that has been updated many times because logically adjacent pages are usually also physically adjacent in a newly built index. (This consideration does not apply to non-B-tree indexes.) It might be worthwhile to reindex periodically just to improve access speed.</p> <p><a class="xref" href="sql-reindex" title="REINDEX">REINDEX</a> can be used safely and easily in all cases. This command requires an <code class="literal">ACCESS EXCLUSIVE</code> lock by default, hence it is often preferable to execute it with its <code class="literal">CONCURRENTLY</code> option, which requires only a <code class="literal">SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE</code> lock.</p>  <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter">  <table summary="Navigation footer"> <tr> <td width="40%" align="left">
