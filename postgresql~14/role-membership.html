<h1>22.3. Role Membership</h1>    <p>It is frequently convenient to group users together to ease management of privileges: that way, privileges can be granted to, or revoked from, a group as a whole. In PostgreSQL this is done by creating a role that represents the group, and then granting <em class="firstterm">membership</em> in the group role to individual user roles.</p> <p>To set up a group role, first create the role:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
CREATE ROLE name;
</pre> <p>Typically a role being used as a group would not have the <code class="literal">LOGIN</code> attribute, though you can set it if you wish.</p> <p>Once the group role exists, you can add and remove members using the <a class="link" href="sql-grant" title="GRANT"><code class="command">GRANT</code></a> and <a class="link" href="sql-revoke" title="REVOKE"><code class="command">REVOKE</code></a> commands:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
GRANT group_role TO role1, ... ;
REVOKE group_role FROM role1, ... ;
</pre> <p>You can grant membership to other group roles, too (since there isn't really any distinction between group roles and non-group roles). The database will not let you set up circular membership loops. Also, it is not permitted to grant membership in a role to <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code>.</p> <p>The members of a group role can use the privileges of the role in two ways. First, every member of a group can explicitly do <a class="link" href="sql-set-role" title="SET ROLE"><code class="command">SET ROLE</code></a> to temporarily <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">become</span>”</span> the group role. In this state, the database session has access to the privileges of the group role rather than the original login role, and any database objects created are considered owned by the group role not the login role. Second, member roles that have the <code class="literal">INHERIT</code> attribute automatically have use of the privileges of roles of which they are members, including any privileges inherited by those roles. As an example, suppose we have done:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
CREATE ROLE joe LOGIN INHERIT;
CREATE ROLE admin NOINHERIT;
CREATE ROLE wheel NOINHERIT;
GRANT admin TO joe;
GRANT wheel TO admin;
</pre> <p>Immediately after connecting as role <code class="literal">joe</code>, a database session will have use of privileges granted directly to <code class="literal">joe</code> plus any privileges granted to <code class="literal">admin</code>, because <code class="literal">joe</code> <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">inherits</span>”</span> <code class="literal">admin</code>'s privileges. However, privileges granted to <code class="literal">wheel</code> are not available, because even though <code class="literal">joe</code> is indirectly a member of <code class="literal">wheel</code>, the membership is via <code class="literal">admin</code> which has the <code class="literal">NOINHERIT</code> attribute. After:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SET ROLE admin;
</pre> <p>the session would have use of only those privileges granted to <code class="literal">admin</code>, and not those granted to <code class="literal">joe</code>. After:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SET ROLE wheel;
</pre> <p>the session would have use of only those privileges granted to <code class="literal">wheel</code>, and not those granted to either <code class="literal">joe</code> or <code class="literal">admin</code>. The original privilege state can be restored with any of:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
SET ROLE joe;
SET ROLE NONE;
RESET ROLE;
</pre> <blockquote class="note"> <h3 class="title">Note</h3> <p>The <code class="command">SET ROLE</code> command always allows selecting any role that the original login role is directly or indirectly a member of. Thus, in the above example, it is not necessary to become <code class="literal">admin</code> before becoming <code class="literal">wheel</code>.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class="note"> <h3 class="title">Note</h3> <p>In the SQL standard, there is a clear distinction between users and roles, and users do not automatically inherit privileges while roles do. This behavior can be obtained in PostgreSQL by giving roles being used as SQL roles the <code class="literal">INHERIT</code> attribute, while giving roles being used as SQL users the <code class="literal">NOINHERIT</code> attribute. However, PostgreSQL defaults to giving all roles the <code class="literal">INHERIT</code> attribute, for backward compatibility with pre-8.1 releases in which users always had use of permissions granted to groups they were members of.</p> </blockquote> <p>The role attributes <code class="literal">LOGIN</code>, <code class="literal">SUPERUSER</code>, <code class="literal">CREATEDB</code>, and <code class="literal">CREATEROLE</code> can be thought of as special privileges, but they are never inherited as ordinary privileges on database objects are. You must actually <code class="command">SET ROLE</code> to a specific role having one of these attributes in order to make use of the attribute. Continuing the above example, we might choose to grant <code class="literal">CREATEDB</code> and <code class="literal">CREATEROLE</code> to the <code class="literal">admin</code> role. Then a session connecting as role <code class="literal">joe</code> would not have these privileges immediately, only after doing <code class="command">SET ROLE admin</code>.</p> <p>To destroy a group role, use <a class="link" href="sql-droprole" title="DROP ROLE"><code class="command">DROP ROLE</code></a>:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
DROP ROLE name;
</pre> <p>Any memberships in the group role are automatically revoked (but the member roles are not otherwise affected).</p>  <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter">  <table summary="Navigation footer"> <tr> <td width="40%" align="left">
