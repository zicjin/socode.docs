<h1>25.3. Log File Maintenance</h1>    <p>It is a good idea to save the database server's log output somewhere, rather than just discarding it via <code class="filename">/dev/null</code>. The log output is invaluable when diagnosing problems. However, the log output tends to be voluminous (especially at higher debug levels) so you won't want to save it indefinitely. You need to <span class="emphasis"><em>rotate</em></span> the log files so that new log files are started and old ones removed after a reasonable period of time.</p> <p>If you simply direct the <span class="systemitem">stderr</span> of <code class="command">postgres</code> into a file, you will have log output, but the only way to truncate the log file is to stop and restart the server. This might be acceptable if you are using PostgreSQL in a development environment, but few production servers would find this behavior acceptable.</p> <p>A better approach is to send the server's <span class="systemitem">stderr</span> output to some type of log rotation program. There is a built-in log rotation facility, which you can use by setting the configuration parameter <code class="varname">logging_collector</code> to <code class="literal">true</code> in <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code>. The control parameters for this program are described in <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-logging#RUNTIME-CONFIG-LOGGING-WHERE" title="20.8.1. Where to Log">Section 20.8.1</a>. You can also use this approach to capture the log data in machine readable CSV (comma-separated values) format.</p> <p>Alternatively, you might prefer to use an external log rotation program if you have one that you are already using with other server software. For example, the rotatelogs tool included in the Apache distribution can be used with PostgreSQL. One way to do this is to pipe the server's <span class="systemitem">stderr</span> output to the desired program. If you start the server with <code class="command">pg_ctl</code>, then <span class="systemitem">stderr</span> is already redirected to <span class="systemitem">stdout</span>, so you just need a pipe command, for example:</p> <pre data-language="sql">
pg_ctl start | rotatelogs /var/log/pgsql_log 86400
</pre> <p>You can combine these approaches by setting up logrotate to collect log files produced by PostgreSQL built-in logging collector. In this case, the logging collector defines the names and location of the log files, while logrotate periodically archives these files. When initiating log rotation, logrotate must ensure that the application sends further output to the new file. This is commonly done with a <code class="literal">postrotate</code> script that sends a <code class="literal">SIGHUP</code> signal to the application, which then reopens the log file. In PostgreSQL, you can run <code class="command">pg_ctl</code> with the <code class="literal">logrotate</code> option instead. When the server receives this command, the server either switches to a new log file or reopens the existing file, depending on the logging configuration (see <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-logging#RUNTIME-CONFIG-LOGGING-WHERE" title="20.8.1. Where to Log">Section 20.8.1</a>).</p> <blockquote class="note"> <h3 class="title">Note</h3> <p>When using static log file names, the server might fail to reopen the log file if the max open file limit is reached or a file table overflow occurs. In this case, log messages are sent to the old log file until a successful log rotation. If logrotate is configured to compress the log file and delete it, the server may lose the messages logged in this time frame. To avoid this issue, you can configure the logging collector to dynamically assign log file names and use a <code class="literal">prerotate</code> script to ignore open log files.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another production-grade approach to managing log output is to send it to syslog and let syslog deal with file rotation. To do this, set the configuration parameter <code class="varname">log_destination</code> to <code class="literal">syslog</code> (to log to syslog only) in <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code>. Then you can send a <code class="literal">SIGHUP</code> signal to the syslog daemon whenever you want to force it to start writing a new log file. If you want to automate log rotation, the logrotate program can be configured to work with log files from syslog.</p> <p>On many systems, however, syslog is not very reliable, particularly with large log messages; it might truncate or drop messages just when you need them the most. Also, on Linux, syslog will flush each message to disk, yielding poor performance. (You can use a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><code class="literal">-</code></span>”</span> at the start of the file name in the syslog configuration file to disable syncing.)</p> <p>Note that all the solutions described above take care of starting new log files at configurable intervals, but they do not handle deletion of old, no-longer-useful log files. You will probably want to set up a batch job to periodically delete old log files. Another possibility is to configure the rotation program so that old log files are overwritten cyclically.</p> <p><a class="ulink" href="https://pgbadger.darold.net/" target="_top">pgBadger</a> is an external project that does sophisticated log file analysis. <a class="ulink" href="https://bucardo.org/check_postgres/" target="_top">check_postgres</a> provides Nagios alerts when important messages appear in the log files, as well as detection of many other extraordinary conditions.</p>  <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter">  <table summary="Navigation footer"> <tr> <td width="40%" align="left">
