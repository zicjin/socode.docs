<h1 id="server-side-rendering"> Server-Side Rendering</h1> <h2 id="the-complete-ssr-guide"> The Complete SSR Guide</h2> <p>We have created a standalone guide for creating server-rendered Vue applications. This is a very in-depth guide for those who are already familiar with client-side Vue development, server-side Node.js development and webpack. Check it out <a href="ssr/introduction">here</a>.</p> <h2 id="nuxt-js"> Nuxt.js</h2> <p>Properly configuring all the discussed aspects of a production-ready server-rendered app can be a daunting task. Luckily, there is an excellent community project that aims to make all of this easier: <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nuxt.js<span> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>. Nuxt.js is a higher-level framework built on top of the Vue ecosystem which provides an extremely streamlined development experience for writing universal Vue applications. Better yet, you can even use it as a static site generator (with pages authored as single-file Vue components)! We highly recommend giving it a try.</p> <h2 id="quasar-framework-ssr-pwa"> Quasar Framework SSR + PWA</h2> <p><a href="https://quasar.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quasar Framework<span> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> will generate an SSR app (with optional PWA handoff) that leverages its best-in-class build system, sensible configuration and developer extensibility to make designing and building your idea a breeze. With over one hundred specific "Material Design 2.0"-compliant components, you can decide which ones to execute on the server, which are available in the browser, and even manage the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags of your site. Quasar is a node.js and webpack based development environment that supercharges and streamlines rapid development of SPA, PWA, SSR, Electron, Capacitor and Cordova appsâ€”all from one codebase.</p> <h2 id="vite-ssr"> Vite SSR</h2> <p><a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vite<span> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> is a new breed of frontend build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience. It consists of two major parts:</p> <ul>
<li><p>A dev server that serves your source files over native ES modules, with rich built-in features and astonishingly fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).</p></li> <li><p>A build command that bundles your code with <a href="https://rollupjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rollup<span> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.</p></li>
</ul> <p>Vite also provides built-in <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support for server-side rendering<span> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>. You can find an example project with Vue <a href="https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/playground/ssr-vue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here<span> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></p>
