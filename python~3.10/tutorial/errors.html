<h1 id="tut-errors"> Errors and Exceptions</h1> <p id="errors-and-exceptions">Until now error messages haven’t been more than mentioned, but if you have tried out the examples you have probably seen some. There are (at least) two distinguishable kinds of errors: <em>syntax errors</em> and <em>exceptions</em>.</p>  <h2 id="tut-syntaxerrors">
<span class="section-number">8.1. </span>Syntax Errors</h2> <p id="syntax-errors">Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most common kind of complaint you get while you are still learning Python:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; while True print('Hello world')
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1
    while True print('Hello world')
                   ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</pre> <p>The parser repeats the offending line and displays a little ‘arrow’ pointing at the earliest point in the line where the error was detected. The error is caused by (or at least detected at) the token <em>preceding</em> the arrow: in the example, the error is detected at the function <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions#print" title="print"><code>print()</code></a>, since a colon (<code>':'</code>) is missing before it. File name and line number are printed so you know where to look in case the input came from a script.</p>   <h2 id="tut-exceptions">
<span class="section-number">8.2. </span>Exceptions</h2> <p id="exceptions">Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it. Errors detected during execution are called <em>exceptions</em> and are not unconditionally fatal: you will soon learn how to handle them in Python programs. Most exceptions are not handled by programs, however, and result in error messages as shown here:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; 10 * (1/0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4 + spam*3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
NameError: name 'spam' is not defined
&gt;&gt;&gt; '2' + 2
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
</pre> <p>The last line of the error message indicates what happened. Exceptions come in different types, and the type is printed as part of the message: the types in the example are <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions#ZeroDivisionError" title="ZeroDivisionError"><code>ZeroDivisionError</code></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions#NameError" title="NameError"><code>NameError</code></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions#TypeError" title="TypeError"><code>TypeError</code></a>. The string printed as the exception type is the name of the built-in exception that occurred. This is true for all built-in exceptions, but need not be true for user-defined exceptions (although it is a useful convention). Standard exception names are built-in identifiers (not reserved keywords).</p> <p>The rest of the line provides detail based on the type of exception and what caused it.</p> <p>The preceding part of the error message shows the context where the exception occurred, in the form of a stack traceback. In general it contains a stack traceback listing source lines; however, it will not display lines read from standard input.</p> <p><a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions#bltin-exceptions"><span class="std std-ref">Built-in Exceptions</span></a> lists the built-in exceptions and their meanings.</p>   <h2 id="tut-handling">
<span class="section-number">8.3. </span>Handling Exceptions</h2> <p id="handling-exceptions">It is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions. Look at the following example, which asks the user for input until a valid integer has been entered, but allows the user to interrupt the program (using <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate"><kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Control</kbd>-<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">C</kbd></kbd> or whatever the operating system supports); note that a user-generated interruption is signalled by raising the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions#KeyboardInterrupt" title="KeyboardInterrupt"><code>KeyboardInterrupt</code></a> exception.</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; while True:
...     try:
...         x = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
...         break
...     except ValueError:
...         print("Oops!  That was no valid number.  Try again...")
...
</pre> <p>The <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/compound_stmts#try"><code>try</code></a> statement works as follows.</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>First, the <em>try clause</em> (the statement(s) between the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/compound_stmts#try"><code>try</code></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/compound_stmts#except"><code>except</code></a> keywords) is executed.</li> <li>If no exception occurs, the <em>except clause</em> is skipped and execution of the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/compound_stmts#try"><code>try</code></a> statement is finished.</li> <li>If an exception occurs during execution of the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/compound_stmts#try"><code>try</code></a> clause, the rest of the clause is skipped. Then, if its type matches the exception named after the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/compound_stmts#except"><code>except</code></a> keyword, the <em>except clause</em> is executed, and then execution continues after the try/except block.</li> <li>If an exception occurs which does not match the exception named in the <em>except clause</em>, it is passed on to outer <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/compound_stmts#try"><code>try</code></a> statements; if no handler is found, it is an <em>unhandled exception</em> and execution stops with a message as shown above.</li> </ul> <p>A <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/compound_stmts#try"><code>try</code></a> statement may have more than one <em>except clause</em>, to specify handlers for different exceptions. At most one handler will be executed. Handlers only handle exceptions that occur in the corresponding <em>try clause</em>, not in other handlers of the same <code>try</code> statement. An <em>except clause</em> may name multiple exceptions as a parenthesized tuple, for example:</p> <pre data-language="python">... except (RuntimeError, TypeError, NameError):
...     pass
</pre> <p>A class in an <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/compound_stmts#except"><code>except</code></a> clause is compatible with an exception if it is the same class or a base class thereof (but not the other way around — an <em>except clause</em> listing a derived class is not compatible with a base class). For example, the following code will print B, C, D in that order:</p> <pre data-language="python">class B(Exception):
    pass

class C(B):
    pass

class D(C):
    pass

for cls in [B, C, D]:
    try:
        raise cls()
    except D:
        print("D")
    except C:
        print("C")
    except B:
        print("B")
</pre> <p>Note that if the <em>except clauses</em> were reversed (with <code>except B</code> first), it would have printed B, B, B — the first matching <em>except clause</em> is triggered.</p> <p>All exceptions inherit from <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions#BaseException" title="BaseException"><code>BaseException</code></a>, and so it can be used to serve as a wildcard. Use this with extreme caution, since it is easy to mask a real programming error in this way! It can also be used to print an error message and then re-raise the exception (allowing a caller to handle the exception as well):</p> <pre data-language="python">import sys

try:
    f = open('myfile.txt')
    s = f.readline()
    i = int(s.strip())
except OSError as err:
    print("OS error: {0}".format(err))
except ValueError:
    print("Could not convert data to an integer.")
except BaseException as err:
    print(f"Unexpected {err=}, {type(err)=}")
    raise
</pre> <p>Alternatively the last except clause may omit the exception name(s), however the exception value must then be retrieved from <code>sys.exc_info()[1]</code>.</p> <p>The <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/compound_stmts#try"><code>try</code></a> … <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/compound_stmts#except"><code>except</code></a> statement has an optional <em>else clause</em>, which, when present, must follow all <em>except clauses</em>. It is useful for code that must be executed if the <em>try clause</em> does not raise an exception. For example:</p> <pre data-language="python">for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
    try:
        f = open(arg, 'r')
    except OSError:
        print('cannot open', arg)
    else:
        print(arg, 'has', len(f.readlines()), 'lines')
        f.close()
</pre> <p>The use of the <code>else</code> clause is better than adding additional code to the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/compound_stmts#try"><code>try</code></a> clause because it avoids accidentally catching an exception that wasn’t raised by the code being protected by the <code>try</code> … <code>except</code> statement.</p> <p>When an exception occurs, it may have an associated value, also known as the exception’s <em>argument</em>. The presence and type of the argument depend on the exception type.</p> <p>The <em>except clause</em> may specify a variable after the exception name. The variable is bound to an exception instance with the arguments stored in <code>instance.args</code>. For convenience, the exception instance defines <code>__str__()</code> so the arguments can be printed directly without having to reference <code>.args</code>. One may also instantiate an exception first before raising it and add any attributes to it as desired.</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; try:
...     raise Exception('spam', 'eggs')
... except Exception as inst:
...     print(type(inst))    # the exception instance
...     print(inst.args)     # arguments stored in .args
...     print(inst)          # __str__ allows args to be printed directly,
...                          # but may be overridden in exception subclasses
...     x, y = inst.args     # unpack args
...     print('x =', x)
...     print('y =', y)
...
&lt;class 'Exception'&gt;
('spam', 'eggs')
('spam', 'eggs')
x = spam
y = eggs
</pre> <p>If an exception has arguments, they are printed as the last part (‘detail’) of the message for unhandled exceptions.</p> <p>Exception handlers don’t just handle exceptions if they occur immediately in the <em>try clause</em>, but also if they occur inside functions that are called (even indirectly) in the <em>try clause</em>. For example:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; def this_fails():
...     x = 1/0
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; try:
...     this_fails()
... except ZeroDivisionError as err:
...     print('Handling run-time error:', err)
...

<span class="section-number">8.4. </span>Raising Exceptions</h2> <p id="raising-exceptions">The <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/simple_stmts#raise"><code>raise</code></a> statement allows the programmer to force a specified exception to occur. For example:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; raise NameError('HiThere')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
NameError: HiThere
</pre> <p>The sole argument to <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/simple_stmts#raise"><code>raise</code></a> indicates the exception to be raised. This must be either an exception instance or an exception class (a class that derives from <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions#Exception" title="Exception"><code>Exception</code></a>). If an exception class is passed, it will be implicitly instantiated by calling its constructor with no arguments:</p> <pre data-language="python">raise ValueError  # shorthand for 'raise ValueError()'
</pre> <p>If you need to determine whether an exception was raised but don’t intend to handle it, a simpler form of the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/simple_stmts#raise"><code>raise</code></a> statement allows you to re-raise the exception:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; try:
...     raise NameError('HiThere')

<span class="section-number">8.5. </span>Exception Chaining</h2> <p id="exception-chaining">The <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/simple_stmts#raise"><code>raise</code></a> statement allows an optional <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/simple_stmts#raise"><code>from</code></a> which enables chaining exceptions. For example:</p> <pre data-language="python"># exc must be exception instance or None.
raise RuntimeError from exc
</pre> <p>This can be useful when you are transforming exceptions. For example:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; def func():

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 4, in &lt;module&gt;
RuntimeError: Failed to open database
</pre> <p>Exception chaining happens automatically when an exception is raised inside an <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/compound_stmts#except"><code>except</code></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/compound_stmts#finally"><code>finally</code></a> section.

<span class="section-number">8.6. </span>User-defined Exceptions</h2> <p id="user-defined-exceptions">Programs may name their own exceptions by creating a new exception class (see <a class="reference internal" href="classes#tut-classes"><span class="std std-ref">Classes</span></a> for more about Python classes). Exceptions should typically be derived from the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions#Exception" title="Exception"><code>Exception</code></a> class, either directly or indirectly.</p> <p>Exception classes can be defined which do anything any other class can do, but are usually kept simple, often only offering a number of attributes that allow information about the error to be extracted by handlers for the exception. When creating a module that can raise several distinct errors, a common practice is to create a base class for exceptions defined by that module, and subclass that to create specific exception classes for different error conditions:</p> <pre data-language="python">class Error(Exception):
