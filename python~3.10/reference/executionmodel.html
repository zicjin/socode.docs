<span class="section-number">4.1. </span>Structure of a program</h2> <p id="execution-model">A Python program is constructed from code blocks. A <em class="dfn">block</em> is a piece of Python program text that is executed as a unit. The following are blocks: a module, a function body, and a class definition. Each command typed interactively is a block. A script file (a file given as standard input to the interpreter or specified as a command line argument to the interpreter) is a code block. A script command (a command specified on the interpreter command line with the <a class="reference internal" href="../using/cmdline#cmdoption-c"><code>-c</code></a> option) is a code block. A module run as a top level script (as module <code>__main__</code>) from the command line using a <a class="reference internal" href="../using/cmdline#cmdoption-m"><code>-m</code></a> argument is also a code block. The string argument passed to the built-in functions <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions#eval" title="eval"><code>eval()</code></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions#exec" title="exec"><code>exec()</code></a> is a code block.</p> <p id="index-2">A code block is executed in an <em class="dfn">execution frame</em>. A frame contains some administrative information (used for debugging) and determines where and how execution continues after the code block’s execution has completed.</p>   <h2 id="naming">
<span class="section-number">4.2. </span>Naming and binding</h2>  <h3 id="index-3">
<span class="section-number">4.2.1. </span>Binding of names</h3> <p id="naming-and-binding"><em class="dfn">Names</em> refer to objects. Names are introduced by name binding operations.</p> <p id="index-5">The following constructs bind names:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>formal parameters to functions,</li> <li>class definitions,</li> <li>function definitions,</li> <li>assignment expressions,</li> <li>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="simple_stmts#assignment"><span class="std std-ref">targets</span></a> that are identifiers if occurring in an assignment:</p> <ul> <li>
<a class="reference internal" href="compound_stmts#for"><code>for</code></a> loop header,</li> <li>after <code>as</code> in a <a class="reference internal" href="compound_stmts#with"><code>with</code></a> statement, <a class="reference internal" href="compound_stmts#except"><code>except</code></a> clause or in the as-pattern in structural pattern matching,</li> <li>in a capture pattern in structural pattern matching</li> </ul> </li> <li>
<a class="reference internal" href="simple_stmts#import"><code>import</code></a> statements.</li> </ul> <p>The <code>import</code> statement of the form <code>from ... import *</code> binds all names defined in the imported module, except those beginning with an underscore. This form may only be used at the module level.</p> <p>A target occurring in a <a class="reference internal" href="simple_stmts#del"><code>del</code></a> statement is also considered bound for this purpose (though the actual semantics are to unbind the name).</p> <p>Each assignment or import statement occurs within a block defined by a class or function definition or at the module level (the top-level code block).</p> <p id="index-6">If a name is bound in a block, it is a local variable of that block, unless declared as <a class="reference internal" href="simple_stmts#nonlocal"><code>nonlocal</code></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="simple_stmts#global"><code>global</code></a>. If a name is bound at the module level, it is a global variable. (The variables of the module code block are local and global.) If a variable is used in a code block but not defined there, it is a <em class="dfn">free variable</em>.</p> <p>Each occurrence of a name in the program text refers to the <em class="dfn">binding</em> of that name established by the following name resolution rules.</p>   <h3 id="resolve-names">
<span class="section-number">4.2.2. </span>Resolution of names</h3> <p id="resolution-of-names">A <em class="dfn">scope</em> defines the visibility of a name within a block. If a local variable is defined in a block, its scope includes that block. If the definition occurs in a function block, the scope extends to any blocks contained within the defining one, unless a contained block introduces a different binding for the name.</p> <p id="index-8">When a name is used in a code block, it is resolved using the nearest enclosing scope. The set of all such scopes visible to a code block is called the block’s <em class="dfn">environment</em>.</p> <p id="index-9">When a name is not found at all, a <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions#NameError" title="NameError"><code>NameError</code></a> exception is raised. If the current scope is a function scope, and the name refers to a local variable that has not yet been bound to a value at the point where the name is used, an <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions#UnboundLocalError" title="UnboundLocalError"><code>UnboundLocalError</code></a> exception is raised. <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions#UnboundLocalError" title="UnboundLocalError"><code>UnboundLocalError</code></a> is a subclass of <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions#NameError" title="NameError"><code>NameError</code></a>.</p> <p>If a name binding operation occurs anywhere within a code block, all uses of the name within the block are treated as references to the current block. This can lead to errors when a name is used within a block before it is bound. This rule is subtle. Python lacks declarations and allows name binding operations to occur anywhere within a code block. The local variables of a code block can be determined by scanning the entire text of the block for name binding operations.</p> <p>If the <a class="reference internal" href="simple_stmts#global"><code>global</code></a> statement occurs within a block, all uses of the names specified in the statement refer to the bindings of those names in the top-level namespace. Names are resolved in the top-level namespace by searching the global namespace, i.e. the namespace of the module containing the code block, and the builtins namespace, the namespace of the module <a class="reference internal" href="../library/builtins#module-builtins" title="builtins: The module that provides the built-in namespace."><code>builtins</code></a>. The global namespace is searched first. If the names are not found there, the builtins namespace is searched. The <code>global</code> statement must precede all uses of the listed names.</p> <p>The <a class="reference internal" href="simple_stmts#global"><code>global</code></a> statement has the same scope as a name binding operation in the same block. If the nearest enclosing scope for a free variable contains a global statement, the free variable is treated as a global.</p> <p>The <a class="reference internal" href="simple_stmts#nonlocal"><code>nonlocal</code></a> statement causes corresponding names to refer to previously bound variables in the nearest enclosing function scope. <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions#SyntaxError" title="SyntaxError"><code>SyntaxError</code></a> is raised at compile time if the given name does not exist in any enclosing function scope.</p> <p id="index-10">The namespace for a module is automatically created the first time a module is imported. The main module for a script is always called <a class="reference internal" href="../library/__main__#module-__main__" title="__main__: The environment where top-level code is run. Covers command-line interfaces, import-time behavior, and ``__name__ == '__main__'``."><code>__main__</code></a>.</p> <p>Class definition blocks and arguments to <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions#exec" title="exec"><code>exec()</code></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions#eval" title="eval"><code>eval()</code></a> are special in the context of name resolution. A class definition is an executable statement that may use and define names. These references follow the normal rules for name resolution with an exception that unbound local variables are looked up in the global namespace. The namespace of the class definition becomes the attribute dictionary of the class. The scope of names defined in a class block is limited to the class block; it does not extend to the code blocks of methods – this includes comprehensions and generator expressions since they are implemented using a function scope. This means that the following will fail:</p> <pre data-language="python">class A:
    a = 42
    b = list(a + i for i in range(10))

<span class="section-number">4.3. </span>Exceptions</h2> <p id="exceptions">Exceptions are a means of breaking out of the normal flow of control of a code block in order to handle errors or other exceptional conditions. An exception is <em>raised</em> at the point where the error is detected; it may be <em>handled</em> by the surrounding code block or by any code block that directly or indirectly invoked the code block where the error occurred.</p> <p>The Python interpreter raises an exception when it detects a run-time error (such as division by zero). A Python program can also explicitly raise an exception with the <a class="reference internal" href="simple_stmts#raise"><code>raise</code></a> statement. Exception handlers are specified with the <a class="reference internal" href="compound_stmts#try"><code>try</code></a> … <a class="reference internal" href="compound_stmts#except"><code>except</code></a> statement. The <a class="reference internal" href="compound_stmts#finally"><code>finally</code></a> clause of such a statement can be used to specify cleanup code which does not handle the exception, but is executed whether an exception occurred or not in the preceding code.</p> <p id="index-14">Python uses the “termination” model of error handling: an exception handler can find out what happened and continue execution at an outer level, but it cannot repair the cause of the error and retry the failing operation (except by re-entering the offending piece of code from the top).</p> <p id="index-15">When an exception is not handled at all, the interpreter terminates execution of the program, or returns to its interactive main loop. In either case, it prints a stack traceback, except when the exception is <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions#SystemExit" title="SystemExit"><code>SystemExit</code></a>.</p> <p>Exceptions are identified by class instances. The <a class="reference internal" href="compound_stmts#except"><code>except</code></a> clause is selected depending on the class of the instance: it must reference the class of the instance or a base class thereof.
