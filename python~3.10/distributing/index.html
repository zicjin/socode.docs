They maintain a variety of tools, documentation and issue trackers on both <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa">GitHub</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypa/">Bitbucket</a>.</li> <li>
<a class="reference internal" href="../library/distutils#module-distutils" title="distutils: Support for building and installing Python modules into an existing Python installation."><code>distutils</code></a> is the original build and distribution system first added to the Python standard library in 1998. While direct use of <a class="reference internal" href="../library/distutils#module-distutils" title="distutils: Support for building and installing Python modules into an existing Python installation."><code>distutils</code></a> is being phased out, it still laid the foundation for the current packaging and distribution infrastructure, and it not only remains part of the standard library, but its name lives on in other ways (such as the name of the mailing list used to coordinate Python packaging standards development).</li> <li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">setuptools</a> is a (largely) drop-in replacement for <a class="reference internal" href="../library/distutils#module-distutils" title="distutils: Support for building and installing Python modules into an existing Python installation."><code>distutils</code></a> first published in 2004. Its most notable addition over the unmodified <a class="reference internal" href="../library/distutils#module-distutils" title="distutils: Support for building and installing Python modules into an existing Python installation."><code>distutils</code></a> tools was the ability to declare dependencies on other packages. It is currently recommended as a more regularly updated alternative to <a class="reference internal" href="../library/distutils#module-distutils" title="distutils: Support for building and installing Python modules into an existing Python installation."><code>distutils</code></a> that offers consistent support for more recent packaging standards across a wide range of Python versions.</li> <li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://wheel.readthedocs.io/">wheel</a> (in this context) is a project that adds the <code>bdist_wheel</code> command to <a class="reference internal" href="../library/distutils#module-distutils" title="distutils: Support for building and installing Python modules into an existing Python installation."><code>distutils</code></a>/<a class="reference external" href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">setuptools</a>. This produces a cross platform binary packaging format (called “wheels” or “wheel files” and defined in <a class="pep reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427" id="index-0"><strong>PEP 427</strong></a>) that allows Python libraries, even those including binary extensions, to be installed on a system without needing to be built locally.</li> </ul>   <h2 id="open-source-licensing-and-collaboration">Open source licensing and collaboration</h2> <p>In most parts of the world, software is automatically covered by copyright. This means that other developers require explicit permission to copy, use, modify and redistribute the software.</p> <p>Open source licensing is a way of explicitly granting such permission in a relatively consistent way, allowing developers to share and collaborate efficiently by making common solutions to various problems freely available. This leaves many developers free to spend more time focusing on the problems that are relatively unique to their specific situation.</p> <p>The distribution tools provided with Python are designed to make it reasonably straightforward for developers to make their own contributions back to that common pool of software if they choose to do so.</p> <p>The same distribution tools can also be used to distribute software within an organisation, regardless of whether that software is published as open source software or not.</p>   <h2 id="installing-the-tools">Installing the tools</h2> <p>The standard library does not include build tools that support modern Python packaging standards, as the core development team has found that it is important to have standard tools that work consistently, even on older versions of Python.</p> <p>The currently recommended build and distribution tools can be installed by invoking the <code>pip</code> module at the command line:</p> <pre data-language="python">python -m pip install setuptools wheel twine
