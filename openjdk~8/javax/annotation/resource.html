public @interface Resource</pre> <div>
<p>The Resource annotation marks a resource that is needed by the application. This annotation may be applied to an application component class, or to fields or methods of the component class. When the annotation is applied to a field or method, the container will inject an instance of the requested resource into the application component when the component is initialized. If the annotation is applied to the component class, the annotation declares a resource that the application will look up at runtime. </p>
<p> Even though this annotation is not marked Inherited, deployment tools are required to examine all superclasses of any component class to discover all uses of this annotation in all superclasses. All such annotation instances specify resources that are needed by the application component. Note that this annotation may appear on private fields and methods of superclasses; the container is required to perform injection in these cases as well.</p>

<p>A product specific name that this resource should be mapped to. The name of this resource, as defined by the <code>name</code> element or defaulted, is a name that is local to the application component using the resource. (It's a name in the JNDI <code>java:comp/env</code> namespace.) Many application servers provide a way to map these local names to names of resources known to the application server. This mapped name is often a <i>global</i> JNDI name, but may be a name of any form. </p>
<p> Application servers are not required to support any particular form or type of mapped name, nor the ability to use mapped names. The mapped name is product-dependent and often installation-dependent. No use of a mapped name is portable.</p>
