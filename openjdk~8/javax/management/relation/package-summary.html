<p>Provides the definition of the Relation Service. The Relation Service is used to record relationships between MBeans in an MBean Server. The Relation Service is itself an MBean. More than one instance of a <a href="relationservice"><code>RelationService</code></a> MBean can be registered in an MBean Server.</p> <p>A <em>relation type</em> defines a relationship between MBeans. It contains <em>roles</em> that the MBeans play in the relationship. Usually there are at least two roles in a relation type.</p> <p>A <em>relation</em> is a named instance of a relation type, where specific MBeans appear in the roles, represented by their <a href="../objectname"><code>ObjectName</code></a>s.</p> <p>For example, suppose there are <code>Module</code> MBeans, representing modules within an application. A <code>DependsOn</code> relation type could express the relationship that some modules depend on others, which could be used to determine the order in which the modules are started or stopped. The <code>DependsOn</code> relation type would have two roles, <code>dependent</code> and <code>dependedOn</code>.</p> <p>Every role is <em>typed</em>, meaning that an MBean that appears in that role must be an instance of the role's type. In the <code>DependsOn</code> example, both roles would be of type <code>Module</code>.</p> <p>Every role has a <em>cardinality</em>, which provides lower and upper bounds on the number of MBeans that can appear in that role in a given relation instance. Usually, the lower and upper bounds are both 1, with exactly one MBean appearing in the role. The cardinality only limits the number of MBeans in the role per relation instance. The same MBean can appear in the same role in any number of instances of a relation type. In the <code>DependsOn</code> example, a given module can depend on many other modules, and be depended on by many others, but any given relation instance links exactly one <code>dependent</code> module with exactly one <code>dependedOn</code> module.</p> <p>A relation type can be created explicitly, as an object implementing the <a href="relationtype"><code>RelationType</code></a> interface, typically a <a href="relationtypesupport"><code>RelationTypeSupport</code></a>. Alternatively, it can be created implicitly using the Relation Service's <a href="relationservicembean#createRelationType-java.lang.String-javax.management.relation.RoleInfo:A-"><code>createRelationType</code></a> method.</p> <p>A relation instance can be created explicitly, as an object implementing the <a href="relation"><code>Relation</code></a> interface, typically a <a href="relationsupport"><code>RelationSupport</code></a>. (A <code>RelationSupport</code> is itself a valid MBean, so it can be registered in the MBean Server, though this is not required.) Alternatively, a relation instance can be created implicitly using the Relation Service's <a href="relationservicembean#createRelation-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-javax.management.relation.RoleList-"><code>createRelation</code></a> method.</p> <p>The <code>DependsOn</code> example might be coded as follows.</p> <pre data-language="java">import java.util.*;
