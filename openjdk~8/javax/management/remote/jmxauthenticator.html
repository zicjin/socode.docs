<h1>Interface JMXAuthenticator</h1>       <pre data-language="java">public interface JMXAuthenticator</pre> <div>

<p>Interface to define how remote credentials are converted into a JAAS Subject. This interface is used by the RMI Connector Server, and can be used by other connector servers.</p> <p>The user-defined authenticator instance is passed to the connector server in the environment map as the value of the attribute <a href="jmxconnectorserver#AUTHENTICATOR"><code>JMXConnectorServer.AUTHENTICATOR</code></a>. For connector servers that use only this authentication system, if this attribute is not present or its value is <code>null</code> then no user authentication will be performed and full access to the methods exported by the <code>MBeanServerConnection</code> object will be allowed.</p> <p>If authentication is successful then an authenticated <a href="../../security/auth/subject"><code>subject</code></a> filled in with its associated <a href="../../../java/security/principal"><code>principals</code></a> is returned. Authorization checks will be then performed based on the given set of principals.</p>
