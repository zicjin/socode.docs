<p>This interface is implemented by any class which wants to receive notifications about the completion of an SSL protocol handshake on a given SSL connection. </p>
<p> When an SSL handshake completes, new security parameters will have been established. Those parameters always include the security keys used to protect messages. They may also include parameters associated with a new <em>session</em> such as authenticated peer identity and a new SSL cipher suite.</p>
