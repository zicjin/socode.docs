<p>This class is the base interface for providing algorithm-specific information to a KeyManagerFactory or TrustManagerFactory. </p>
<p> In some cases, initialization parameters other than keystores may be needed by a provider. Users of that particular provider are expected to pass an implementation of the appropriate sub-interface of this class as defined by the provider. The provider can then call the specified methods in the <code>ManagerFactoryParameters</code> implementation to obtain the needed information.</p>
