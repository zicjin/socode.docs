extends Object
implements AsynchronousChannel</pre> <div>
<p>An asynchronous channel for reading, writing, and manipulating a file. </p>
<p> An asynchronous file channel is created when a file is opened by invoking one of the <a href="asynchronousfilechannel#open-java.nio.file.Path-java.util.Set-java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService-java.nio.file.attribute.FileAttribute...-"><code>open</code></a> methods defined by this class. The file contains a variable-length sequence of bytes that can be read and written and whose current size can be <a href="asynchronousfilechannel#size--"><code>queried</code></a>. The size of the file increases when bytes are written beyond its current size; the size of the file decreases when it is <a href="asynchronousfilechannel#truncate-long-"><code>truncated</code></a>. </p>
<p> An asynchronous file channel does not have a <i>current position</i> within the file. Instead, the file position is specified to each read and write method that initiates asynchronous operations. A <a href="completionhandler"><code>CompletionHandler</code></a> is specified as a parameter and is invoked to consume the result of the I/O operation. This class also defines read and write methods that initiate asynchronous operations, returning a <a href="../../util/concurrent/future"><code>Future</code></a> to represent the pending result of the operation. The <code>Future</code> may be used to check if the operation has completed, wait for its completion, and retrieve the result. </p>
<p> In addition to read and write operations, this class defines the following operations: </p> <ul> <li><p> Updates made to a file may be <a href="asynchronousfilechannel#force-boolean-"><code><i>forced
   out</i></code></a> to the underlying storage device, ensuring that data are not lost in the event of a system crash. </p></li> <li><p> A region of a file may be <a href="asynchronousfilechannel#lock-long-long-boolean-A-java.nio.channels.CompletionHandler-"><code><i>locked</i></code></a> against access by other programs. </p></li> </ul> <p> An <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> is associated with a thread pool to which tasks are submitted to handle I/O events and dispatch to completion handlers that consume the results of I/O operations on the channel. The completion handler for an I/O operation initiated on a channel is guaranteed to be invoked by one of the threads in the thread pool (This ensures that the completion handler is run by a thread with the expected <em>identity</em>). Where an I/O operation completes immediately, and the initiating thread is itself a thread in the thread pool, then the completion handler may be invoked directly by the initiating thread. When an <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> is created without specifying a thread pool then the channel is associated with a system-dependent default thread pool that may be shared with other channels. The default thread pool is configured by the system properties defined by the <a href="asynchronouschannelgroup"><code>AsynchronousChannelGroup</code></a> class. </p>
<p> Channels of this type are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. The <a href="channel#close--"><code>close</code></a> method may be invoked at any time, as specified by the <a href="channel"><code>Channel</code></a> interface. This causes all outstanding asynchronous operations on the channel to complete with the exception <a href="asynchronouscloseexception"><code>AsynchronousCloseException</code></a>. Multiple read and write operations may be outstanding at the same time. When multiple read and write operations are outstanding then the ordering of the I/O operations, and the order that the completion handlers are invoked, is not specified; they are not, in particular, guaranteed to execute in the order that the operations were initiated. The <a href="../bytebuffer"><code>ByteBuffers</code></a> used when reading or writing are not safe for use by multiple concurrent I/O operations. Furthermore, after an I/O operation is initiated then care should be taken to ensure that the buffer is not accessed until after the operation has completed. </p>
<p> As with <a href="filechannel"><code>FileChannel</code></a>, the view of a file provided by an instance of this class is guaranteed to be consistent with other views of the same file provided by other instances in the same program. The view provided by an instance of this class may or may not, however, be consistent with the views seen by other concurrently-running programs due to caching performed by the underlying operating system and delays induced by network-filesystem protocols. This is true regardless of the language in which these other programs are written, and whether they are running on the same machine or on some other machine. The exact nature of any such inconsistencies are system-dependent and are therefore unspecified.</p>

<p> The <code>executor</code> parameter is the <a href="../../util/concurrent/executorservice"><code>ExecutorService</code></a> to which tasks are submitted to handle I/O events and dispatch completion results for operations initiated on resulting channel. The nature of these tasks is highly implementation specific and so care should be taken when configuring the <code>Executor</code>.

Shutting down the executor service while the channel is open results in unspecified behavior. </p>

<p>Forces any updates to this channel's file to be written to the storage device that contains it. </p>
<p> If this channel's file resides on a local storage device then when this method returns it is guaranteed that all changes made to the file since this channel was created, or since this method was last invoked, will have been written to that device. This is useful for ensuring that critical information is not lost in the event of a system crash. </p>
<p> If the file does not reside on a local device then no such guarantee is made. </p>
<p> The <code>metaData</code> parameter can be used to limit the number of I/O operations that this method is required to perform. Passing <code>false</code> for this parameter indicates that only updates to the file's content need be written to storage; passing <code>true</code> indicates that updates to both the file's content and metadata must be written, which generally requires at least one more I/O operation. Whether this parameter actually has any effect is dependent upon the underlying operating system and is therefore unspecified. </p>
<p> Invoking this method may cause an I/O operation to occur even if the channel was only opened for reading. Some operating systems, for example, maintain a last-access time as part of a file's metadata, and this time is updated whenever the file is read. Whether or not this is actually done is system-dependent and is therefore unspecified. </p>
<p> This method is only guaranteed to force changes that were made to this channel's file via the methods defined in this class.</p>

<p>Acquires a lock on the given region of this channel's file. </p>
<p> This method initiates an operation to acquire a lock on the given region of this channel's file. The <code>handler</code> parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when the lock is acquired (or the operation fails). The result passed to the completion handler is the resulting <code>FileLock</code>. </p>
<p> The region specified by the <code>position</code> and <code>size</code> parameters need not be contained within, or even overlap, the actual underlying file. Lock regions are fixed in size; if a locked region initially contains the end of the file and the file grows beyond the region then the new portion of the file will not be covered by the lock. If a file is expected to grow in size and a lock on the entire file is required then a region starting at zero, and no smaller than the expected maximum size of the file, should be locked. The two-argument <a href="asynchronousfilechannel#lock-A-java.nio.channels.CompletionHandler-"><code>lock(Object,CompletionHandler)</code></a> method simply locks a region of size <a href="../../lang/long#MAX_VALUE"><code>Long.MAX_VALUE</code></a>. If a lock that overlaps the requested region is already held by this Java virtual machine, or this method has been invoked to lock an overlapping region and that operation has not completed, then this method throws <a href="overlappingfilelockexception"><code>OverlappingFileLockException</code></a>. </p>
<p> Some operating systems do not support a mechanism to acquire a file lock in an asynchronous manner. Consequently an implementation may acquire the file lock in a background thread or from a task executed by a thread in the associated thread pool. If there are many lock operations outstanding then it may consume threads in the Java virtual machine for indefinite periods. </p>
<p> Some operating systems do not support shared locks, in which case a request for a shared lock is automatically converted into a request for an exclusive lock. Whether the newly-acquired lock is shared or exclusive may be tested by invoking the resulting lock object's <a href="filelock#isShared--"><code>isShared</code></a> method. </p>
<p> File locks are held on behalf of the entire Java virtual machine. They are not suitable for controlling access to a file by multiple threads within the same virtual machine.</p>
