<h1>Interface Group</h1>     <dl> <dt>All Superinterfaces:</dt> <dd><a href="../principal">Principal</a></dd> </dl>   <pre data-language="java">public interface Group
extends Principal</pre> <div>
<p>This interface is used to represent a group of principals. (A principal represents an entity such as an individual user or a company). </p>
<p> Note that Group extends Principal. Thus, either a Principal or a Group can be passed as an argument to methods containing a Principal parameter. For example, you can add either a Principal or a Group to a Group object by calling the object's <code>addMember</code> method, passing it the Principal or Group.</p>
