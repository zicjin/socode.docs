<p>Acquires the write lock if neither the read nor write lock are held by another thread and returns immediately with the value <code>true</code>, setting the write lock hold count to one. Even when this lock has been set to use a fair ordering policy, a call to <code>tryLock()</code> <em>will</em> immediately acquire the lock if it is available, whether or not other threads are currently waiting for the write lock. This "barging" behavior can be useful in certain circumstances, even though it breaks fairness. If you want to honor the fairness setting for this lock, then use <a href="reentrantreadwritelock.writelock#tryLock-long-java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit-"><code>tryLock(0, TimeUnit.SECONDS) </code></a> which is almost equivalent (it also detects interruption). </p>

<p>Acquires the write lock if it is not held by another thread within the given waiting time and the current thread has not been <a href="../../../lang/thread#interrupt--">interrupted</a>. </p>
<p>Acquires the write lock if neither the read nor write lock are held by another thread and returns immediately with the value <code>true</code>, setting the write lock hold count to one. If this lock has been set to use a fair ordering policy then an available lock <em>will not</em> be acquired if any other threads are waiting for the write lock. This is in contrast to the <a href="reentrantreadwritelock.writelock#tryLock--"><code>tryLock()</code></a> method. If you want a timed <code>tryLock</code> that does permit barging on a fair lock then combine the timed and un-timed forms together: </p>
<pre data-language="java">if (lock.tryLock() ||
     lock.tryLock(timeout, unit)) {
   ...
 }</pre> <p>If the current thread already holds this lock then the hold count is incremented by one and the method returns <code>true</code>. </p>
<p>If the lock is held by another thread then the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of three things happens: </p>
<ul> <li>The write lock is acquired by the current thread; or </li>
<li>Some other thread <a href="../../../lang/thread#interrupt--">interrupts</a> the current thread; or </li>
<li>The specified waiting time elapses </li>
</ul> <p>If the write lock is acquired then the value <code>true</code> is returned and the write lock hold count is set to one. </p>
<p>If the current thread: </p>
<ul> <li>has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or </li>
<li>is <a href="../../../lang/thread#interrupt--">interrupted</a> while acquiring the write lock, </li>
</ul> then <a href="../../../lang/interruptedexception"><code>InterruptedException</code></a> is thrown and the current thread's interrupted status is cleared. <p>If the specified waiting time elapses then the value <code>false</code> is returned. If the time is less than or equal to zero, the method will not wait at all. </p>
<p>In this implementation, as this method is an explicit interruption point, preference is given to responding to the interrupt over normal or reentrant acquisition of the lock, and over reporting the elapse of the waiting time.</p>

<p>The returned <a href="condition"><code>Condition</code></a> instance supports the same usages as do the <a href="../../../lang/object"><code>Object</code></a> monitor methods (<a href="../../../lang/object#wait--"><code>wait</code></a>, <a href="../../../lang/object#notify--"><code>notify</code></a>, and <a href="../../../lang/object#notifyAll--"><code>notifyAll</code></a>) when used with the built-in monitor lock. </p>
<ul> <li>If this write lock is not held when any <a href="condition"><code>Condition</code></a> method is called then an <a href="../../../lang/illegalmonitorstateexception"><code>IllegalMonitorStateException</code></a> is thrown. (Read locks are held independently of write locks, so are not checked or affected. However it is essentially always an error to invoke a condition waiting method when the current thread has also acquired read locks, since other threads that could unblock it will not be able to acquire the write lock.) </li>
<li>When the condition <a href="condition#await--">waiting</a> methods are called the write lock is released and, before they return, the write lock is reacquired and the lock hold count restored to what it was when the method was called. </li>
<li>If a thread is <a href="../../../lang/thread#interrupt--">interrupted</a> while waiting then the wait will terminate, an <a href="../../../lang/interruptedexception"><code>InterruptedException</code></a> will be thrown, and the thread's interrupted status will be cleared. </li>
<li> Waiting threads are signalled in FIFO order. </li>
<li>The ordering of lock reacquisition for threads returning from waiting methods is the same as for threads initially acquiring the lock, which is in the default case not specified, but for <em>fair</em> locks favors those threads that have been waiting the longest. </li>
