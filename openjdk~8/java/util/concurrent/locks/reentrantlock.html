</dd> </dl>   <pre data-language="java">public class ReentrantLock
extends Object
implements Lock, Serializable</pre> <div>
<p>A reentrant mutual exclusion <a href="lock"><code>Lock</code></a> with the same basic behavior and semantics as the implicit monitor lock accessed using <code>synchronized</code> methods and statements, but with extended capabilities. </p>
<p>A <code>ReentrantLock</code> is <em>owned</em> by the thread last successfully locking, but not yet unlocking it. A thread invoking <code>lock</code> will return, successfully acquiring the lock, when the lock is not owned by another thread. The method will return immediately if the current thread already owns the lock. This can be checked using methods <a href="reentrantlock#isHeldByCurrentThread--"><code>isHeldByCurrentThread()</code></a>, and <a href="reentrantlock#getHoldCount--"><code>getHoldCount()</code></a>. </p>
<p>The constructor for this class accepts an optional <em>fairness</em> parameter. When set <code>true</code>, under contention, locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting thread. Otherwise this lock does not guarantee any particular access order. Programs using fair locks accessed by many threads may display lower overall throughput (i.e., are slower; often much slower) than those using the default setting, but have smaller variances in times to obtain locks and guarantee lack of starvation. Note however, that fairness of locks does not guarantee fairness of thread scheduling. Thus, one of many threads using a fair lock may obtain it multiple times in succession while other active threads are not progressing and not currently holding the lock. Also note that the untimed <a href="reentrantlock#tryLock--"><code>tryLock()</code></a> method does not honor the fairness setting. It will succeed if the lock is available even if other threads are waiting. </p>
<p>It is recommended practice to <em>always</em> immediately follow a call to <code>lock</code> with a <code>try</code> block, most typically in a before/after construction such as: </p>
<pre data-language="java">class X {
   private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
   // ...

   public void m() {
     lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
     try {
       // ... method body
     } finally {
       lock.unlock()
     }
   }
 }</pre> <p>In addition to implementing the <a href="lock"><code>Lock</code></a> interface, this class defines a number of <code>public</code> and <code>protected</code> methods for inspecting the state of the lock. Some of these methods are only useful for instrumentation and monitoring. </p>
<p>Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of its state when serialized. </p>
<p>This lock supports a maximum of 2147483647 recursive locks by the same thread. Attempts to exceed this limit result in <a href="../../../lang/error"><code>Error</code></a> throws from locking methods.</p>

This is in contrast to the <a href="reentrantlock#tryLock--"><code>tryLock()</code></a> method.

<p>Queries the number of holds on this lock by the current thread. </p>
<p>A thread has a hold on a lock for each lock action that is not matched by an unlock action. </p>
<p>The hold count information is typically only used for testing and debugging purposes. For example, if a certain section of code should not be entered with the lock already held then we can assert that fact: </p>
<pre data-language="java">class X {
   ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
   // ...
   public void m() {
     assert lock.getHoldCount() == 0;
     lock.lock();

       // ... method body
     } finally {
       lock.unlock();

<p>Queries if this lock is held by the current thread. </p>
<p>Analogous to the <a href="../../../lang/thread#holdsLock-java.lang.Object-"><code>Thread.holdsLock(Object)</code></a> method for built-in monitor locks, this method is typically used for debugging and testing. For example, a method that should only be called while a lock is held can assert that this is the case: </p>
<pre data-language="java">class X {
   ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
   // ...

   public void m() {
       assert lock.isHeldByCurrentThread();
       // ... method body
   }
 }</pre> <p>It can also be used to ensure that a reentrant lock is used in a non-reentrant manner, for example: </p>
<pre data-language="java">class X {
   ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
   // ...

   public void m() {
       assert !lock.isHeldByCurrentThread();
       lock.lock();
       try {
