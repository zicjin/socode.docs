<h1>Class LockSupport</h1>   <ul class="inheritance"> <li><a href="../../../lang/object">java.lang.Object</a></li> <li> <ul class="inheritance"> <li>java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport</li> </ul> </li> </ul>     <pre data-language="java">public class LockSupport
extends Object</pre> <div>
<p>Basic thread blocking primitives for creating locks and other synchronization classes. </p>
<p>This class associates, with each thread that uses it, a permit (in the sense of the <a href="../semaphore"><code>Semaphore</code></a> class). A call to <code>park</code> will return immediately if the permit is available, consuming it in the process; otherwise it <em>may</em> block. A call to <code>unpark</code> makes the permit available, if it was not already available. (Unlike with Semaphores though, permits do not accumulate. There is at most one.) </p>
<p>Methods <code>park</code> and <code>unpark</code> provide efficient means of blocking and unblocking threads that do not encounter the problems that cause the deprecated methods <code>Thread.suspend</code> and <code>Thread.resume</code> to be unusable for such purposes: Races between one thread invoking <code>park</code> and another thread trying to <code>unpark</code> it will preserve liveness, due to the permit. Additionally, <code>park</code> will return if the caller's thread was interrupted, and timeout versions are supported. The <code>park</code> method may also return at any other time, for "no reason", so in general must be invoked within a loop that rechecks conditions upon return. In this sense <code>park</code> serves as an optimization of a "busy wait" that does not waste as much time spinning, but must be paired with an <code>unpark</code> to be effective. </p>
<p>The three forms of <code>park</code> each also support a <code>blocker</code> object parameter. This object is recorded while the thread is blocked to permit monitoring and diagnostic tools to identify the reasons that threads are blocked. (Such tools may access blockers using method <a href="locksupport#getBlocker-java.lang.Thread-"><code>getBlocker(Thread)</code></a>.) The use of these forms rather than the original forms without this parameter is strongly encouraged. The normal argument to supply as a <code>blocker</code> within a lock implementation is <code>this</code>. </p>
<p>These methods are designed to be used as tools for creating higher-level synchronization utilities, and are not in themselves useful for most concurrency control applications. The <code>park</code> method is designed for use only in constructions of the form: </p>
<pre data-language="java">while (!canProceed()) { ... LockSupport.park(this); }</pre> where neither <code>canProceed</code> nor any other actions prior to the call to <code>park</code> entail locking or blocking. Because only one permit is associated with each thread, any intermediary uses of <code>park</code> could interfere with its intended effects. <p><b>Sample Usage.</b> Here is a sketch of a first-in-first-out non-reentrant lock class: </p>
<pre data-language="java">class FIFOMutex {
   private final AtomicBoolean locked = new AtomicBoolean(false);
   private final Queue&lt;Thread&gt; waiters
     = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue&lt;Thread&gt;();

   public void lock() {
     boolean wasInterrupted = false;
     Thread current = Thread.currentThread();
     waiters.add(current);

     // Block while not first in queue or cannot acquire lock
     while (waiters.peek() != current ||
            !locked.compareAndSet(false, true)) {
       LockSupport.park(this);
       if (Thread.interrupted()) // ignore interrupts while waiting
         wasInterrupted = true;
     }

     waiters.remove();
     if (wasInterrupted)          // reassert interrupt status on exit
       current.interrupt();
   }

   public void unlock() {
     locked.set(false);
     LockSupport.unpark(waiters.peek());
   }
