<p>An object that executes submitted <a href="../../lang/runnable"><code>Runnable</code></a> tasks. This interface provides a way of decoupling task submission from the mechanics of how each task will be run, including details of thread use, scheduling, etc. An <code>Executor</code> is normally used instead of explicitly creating threads. For example, rather than invoking <code>new Thread(new(RunnableTask())).start()</code> for each of a set of tasks, you might use: <pre data-language="java">Executor executor = anExecutor;
 executor.execute(new RunnableTask1());
 executor.execute(new RunnableTask2());
 ...</pre> However, the <code>Executor</code> interface does not strictly require that execution be asynchronous. In the simplest case, an executor can run the submitted task immediately in the caller's thread: <pre data-language="java">class DirectExecutor implements Executor {
   public void execute(Runnable r) {
     r.run();
   }
 }</pre> More typically, tasks are executed in some thread other than the caller's thread. The executor below spawns a new thread for each task. <pre data-language="java">class ThreadPerTaskExecutor implements Executor {
   public void execute(Runnable r) {
     new Thread(r).start();
   }
 }</pre> Many <code>Executor</code> implementations impose some sort of limitation on how and when tasks are scheduled. The executor below serializes the submission of tasks to a second executor, illustrating a composite executor. <pre data-language="java">class SerialExecutor implements Executor {
   final Queue&lt;Runnable&gt; tasks = new ArrayDeque&lt;Runnable&gt;();
   final Executor executor;
   Runnable active;

   SerialExecutor(Executor executor) {
     this.executor = executor;
   }

   public synchronized void execute(final Runnable r) {
     tasks.offer(new Runnable() {
       public void run() {
         try {
           r.run();
         } finally {
           scheduleNext();
         }
       }
     });
     if (active == null) {
       scheduleNext();
     }
   }

   protected synchronized void scheduleNext() {
     if ((active = tasks.poll()) != null) {
       executor.execute(active);
     }
   }
 }</pre> The <code>Executor</code> implementations provided in this package implement <a href="executorservice"><code>ExecutorService</code></a>, which is a more extensive interface. The <a href="threadpoolexecutor"><code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code></a> class provides an extensible thread pool implementation. The <a href="executors"><code>Executors</code></a> class provides convenient factory methods for these Executors. </p>
<p>Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to submitting a <code>Runnable</code> object to an <code>Executor</code> <a href="package-summary#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a> its execution begins, perhaps in another thread.</p>
