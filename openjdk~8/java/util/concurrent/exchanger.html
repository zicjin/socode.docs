<code>V</code> - The type of objects that may be exchanged</dd> </dl>   <pre data-language="java">public class Exchanger&lt;V&gt;
extends Object</pre> <div>
<p>A synchronization point at which threads can pair and swap elements within pairs. Each thread presents some object on entry to the <a href="exchanger#exchange-V-"><code>exchange</code></a> method, matches with a partner thread, and receives its partner's object on return. An Exchanger may be viewed as a bidirectional form of a <a href="synchronousqueue"><code>SynchronousQueue</code></a>. Exchangers may be useful in applications such as genetic algorithms and pipeline designs. </p>
<p><b>Sample Usage:</b> Here are the highlights of a class that uses an <code>Exchanger</code> to swap buffers between threads so that the thread filling the buffer gets a freshly emptied one when it needs it, handing off the filled one to the thread emptying the buffer. </p>
<pre data-language="java">class FillAndEmpty {
   Exchanger&lt;DataBuffer&gt; exchanger = new Exchanger&lt;DataBuffer&gt;();
   DataBuffer initialEmptyBuffer = ... a made-up type
   DataBuffer initialFullBuffer = ...

   class FillingLoop implements Runnable {
     public void run() {
       DataBuffer currentBuffer = initialEmptyBuffer;
       try {
         while (currentBuffer != null) {
           addToBuffer(currentBuffer);
           if (currentBuffer.isFull())
             currentBuffer = exchanger.exchange(currentBuffer);
         }
       } catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ... }
     }
   }

   class EmptyingLoop implements Runnable {
     public void run() {
       DataBuffer currentBuffer = initialFullBuffer;
       try {
         while (currentBuffer != null) {
           takeFromBuffer(currentBuffer);
           if (currentBuffer.isEmpty())
             currentBuffer = exchanger.exchange(currentBuffer);
         }
       } catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}
     }
   }

   void start() {
     new Thread(new FillingLoop()).start();
     new Thread(new EmptyingLoop()).start();
   }
