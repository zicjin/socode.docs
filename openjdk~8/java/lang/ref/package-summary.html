A program may use a reference object to maintain a reference to some other object in such a way that the latter object may still be reclaimed by the collector. A program may also arrange to be notified some time after the collector has determined that the reachability of a given object has changed. </p> <dl> <dt>Since:</dt> <dd>1.2 </dd> </dl><div class="_attribution">
