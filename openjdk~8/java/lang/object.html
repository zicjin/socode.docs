<p>Returns a hash code value for the object. This method is supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by <a href="../util/hashmap"><code>HashMap</code></a>. </p>
<p> The general contract of <code>hashCode</code> is: </p>
<ul> <li>Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application, the <code>hashCode</code> method must consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in <code>equals</code> comparisons on the object is modified. This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application. </li>
<li>If two objects are equal according to the <code>equals(Object)</code> method, then calling the <code>hashCode</code> method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result. </li>
<li>It is <em>not</em> required that if two objects are unequal according to the <a href="object#equals-java.lang.Object-"><code>equals(java.lang.Object)</code></a> method, then calling the <code>hashCode</code> method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results. However, the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables. </li>
</ul> <p> As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by class <code>Object</code> does return distinct integers for distinct objects. (This is typically implemented by converting the internal address of the object into an integer, but this implementation technique is not required by the Java™ programming language.)</p>

<p>Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one. </p>
<p> The <code>equals</code> method implements an equivalence relation on non-null object references: </p>
<ul> <li>It is <i>reflexive</i>: for any non-null reference value <code>x</code>, <code>x.equals(x)</code> should return <code>true</code>. </li>
<li>It is <i>symmetric</i>: for any non-null reference values <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, <code>x.equals(y)</code> should return <code>true</code> if and only if <code>y.equals(x)</code> returns <code>true</code>. </li>
<li>It is <i>transitive</i>: for any non-null reference values <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>, if <code>x.equals(y)</code> returns <code>true</code> and <code>y.equals(z)</code> returns <code>true</code>, then <code>x.equals(z)</code> should return <code>true</code>. </li>
<li>It is <i>consistent</i>: for any non-null reference values <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, multiple invocations of <code>x.equals(y)</code> consistently return <code>true</code> or consistently return <code>false</code>, provided no information used in <code>equals</code> comparisons on the objects is modified. </li>
<li>For any non-null reference value <code>x</code>, <code>x.equals(null)</code> should return <code>false</code>. </li>
</ul> <p> The <code>equals</code> method for class <code>Object</code> implements the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects; that is, for any non-null reference values <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, this method returns <code>true</code> if and only if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> refer to the same object (<code>x == y</code> has the value <code>true</code>). </p>
<p> Note that it is generally necessary to override the <code>hashCode</code> method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the general contract for the <code>hashCode</code> method, which states that equal objects must have equal hash codes.</p>

                throws CloneNotSupportedException</pre> <div>
<p>Creates and returns a copy of this object. The precise meaning of "copy" may depend on the class of the object. The general intent is that, for any object <code>x</code>, the expression: <pre data-language="java">x.clone() != x</pre> will be true, and that the expression: <pre data-language="java">x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()</pre> will be <code>true</code>, but these are not absolute requirements. While it is typically the case that: <pre data-language="java">x.clone().equals(x)</pre> will be <code>true</code>, this is not an absolute requirement. </p>
<p> By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling <code>super.clone</code>. If a class and all of its superclasses (except <code>Object</code>) obey this convention, it will be the case that <code>x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()</code>. </p>
<p> By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent of this object (which is being cloned). To achieve this independence, it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned by <code>super.clone</code> before returning it. Typically, this means copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure" of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these objects with references to the copies. If a class contains only primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually the case that no fields in the object returned by <code>super.clone</code> need to be modified. </p>
<p> The method <code>clone</code> for class <code>Object</code> performs a specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does not implement the interface <code>Cloneable</code>, then a <code>CloneNotSupportedException</code> is thrown. Note that all arrays are considered to implement the interface <code>Cloneable</code> and that the return type of the <code>clone</code> method of an array type <code>T[]</code> is <code>T[]</code> where T is any reference or primitive type. Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation. </p>
<p> The class <code>Object</code> does not itself implement the interface <code>Cloneable</code>, so calling the <code>clone</code> method on an object whose class is <code>Object</code> will result in throwing an exception at run time.</p>

<p> The <code>toString</code> method for class <code>Object</code> returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the object is an instance, the at-sign character `<code>@</code>', and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object. In other words, this method returns a string equal to the value of: </p>

<p>Causes the current thread to wait until either another thread invokes the <a href="object#notify--"><code>notify()</code></a> method or the <a href="object#notifyAll--"><code>notifyAll()</code></a> method for this object, or a specified amount of time has elapsed. </p>
<p> The current thread must own this object's monitor. </p>
<p> This method causes the current thread (call it <var>T</var>) to place itself in the wait set for this object and then to relinquish any and all synchronization claims on this object. Thread <var>T</var> becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of four things happens: </p>
<ul> <li>Some other thread invokes the <code>notify</code> method for this object and thread <var>T</var> happens to be arbitrarily chosen as the thread to be awakened. </li>
<li>Some other thread invokes the <code>notifyAll</code> method for this object. </li>
<li>Some other thread <a href="thread#interrupt--">interrupts</a> thread <var>T</var>. </li>
<li>The specified amount of real time has elapsed, more or less. If <code>timeout</code> is zero, however, then real time is not taken into consideration and the thread simply waits until notified. </li>
</ul> The thread <var>T</var> is then removed from the wait set for this object and re-enabled for thread scheduling. It then competes in the usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the object; once it has gained control of the object, all its synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the <code>wait</code> method was invoked. Thread <var>T</var> then returns from the invocation of the <code>wait</code> method. Thus, on return from the <code>wait</code> method, the synchronization state of the object and of thread <code>T</code> is exactly as it was when the <code>wait</code> method was invoked. <p> A thread can also wake up without being notified, interrupted, or timing out, a so-called <i>spurious wakeup</i>. While this will rarely occur in practice, applications must guard against it by testing for the condition that should have caused the thread to be awakened, and continuing to wait if the condition is not satisfied. In other words, waits should always occur in loops, like this one: </p>

<p> The general contract of <code>finalize</code> is that it is invoked if and when the Java™ virtual machine has determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be finalized. The <code>finalize</code> method may take any action, including making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose of <code>finalize</code>, however, is to perform cleanup actions before the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is permanently discarded. </p>
<p> The <code>finalize</code> method of class <code>Object</code> performs no special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of <code>Object</code> may override this definition. </p>
<p> The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will invoke the <code>finalize</code> method for any given object. It is guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method, the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates. </p>
<p> After the <code>finalize</code> method has been invoked for an object, no further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized, at which point the object may be discarded. </p>
<p> The <code>finalize</code> method is never invoked more than once by a Java virtual machine for any given object. </p>
<p> Any exception thrown by the <code>finalize</code> method causes the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise ignored.</p>
