public @interface Retention</pre> <div>
<p>Indicates how long annotations with the annotated type are to be retained. If no Retention annotation is present on an annotation type declaration, the retention policy defaults to <code>RetentionPolicy.CLASS</code>. </p>
<p>A Retention meta-annotation has effect only if the meta-annotated type is used directly for annotation. It has no effect if the meta-annotated type is used as a member type in another annotation type.</p>
