public @interface FunctionalInterface</pre> <div>
<p>An informative annotation type used to indicate that an interface type declaration is intended to be a <i>functional interface</i> as defined by the Java Language Specification. Conceptually, a functional interface has exactly one abstract method. Since <a href="reflect/method#isDefault--">default methods</a> have an implementation, they are not abstract. If an interface declares an abstract method overriding one of the public methods of <code>java.lang.Object</code>, that also does <em>not</em> count toward the interface's abstract method count since any implementation of the interface will have an implementation from <code>java.lang.Object</code> or elsewhere. </p>
<p>Note that instances of functional interfaces can be created with lambda expressions, method references, or constructor references. </p>
<p>If a type is annotated with this annotation type, compilers are required to generate an error message unless: </p>
<ul> <li> The type is an interface type and not an annotation type, enum, or class. </li>
<li> The annotated type satisfies the requirements of a functional interface. </li>
</ul> <p>However, the compiler will treat any interface meeting the definition of a functional interface as a functional interface regardless of whether or not a <code>FunctionalInterface</code> annotation is present on the interface declaration.</p>
