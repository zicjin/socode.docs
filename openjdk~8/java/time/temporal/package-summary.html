<p> Access to date and time using fields and units, and date time adjusters. </p> <p> This package expands on the base package to provide additional functionality for more powerful use cases. Support is included for: </p> <ul> <li>Units of date-time, such as years, months, days and hours</li> <li>Fields of date-time, such as month-of-year, day-of-week or hour-of-day</li> <li>Date-time adjustment functions</li> <li>Different definitions of weeks</li> </ul> <h2>Fields and Units</h2> <p> Dates and times are expressed in terms of fields and units. A unit is used to measure an amount of time, such as years, days or minutes. All units implement <a href="temporalunit"><code>TemporalUnit</code></a>. The set of well known units is defined in <a href="chronounit"><code>ChronoUnit</code></a>, such as <code>DAYS</code>. The unit interface is designed to allow application defined units. </p> <p> A field is used to express part of a larger date-time, such as year, month-of-year or second-of-minute. All fields implement <a href="temporalfield"><code>TemporalField</code></a>. The set of well known fields are defined in <a href="chronofield"><code>ChronoField</code></a>, such as <code>HOUR_OF_DAY</code>. Additional fields are defined by <a href="julianfields"><code>JulianFields</code></a>, <a href="weekfields"><code>WeekFields</code></a> and <a href="isofields"><code>IsoFields</code></a>. The field interface is designed to allow application defined fields. </p> <p> This package provides tools that allow the units and fields of date and time to be accessed in a general way most suited for frameworks. <a href="temporal"><code>Temporal</code></a> provides the abstraction for date time types that support fields. Its methods support getting the value of a field, creating a new date time with the value of a field modified, and querying for additional information, typically used to extract the offset or time-zone. </p> <p> One use of fields in application code is to retrieve fields for which there is no convenience method. For example, getting the day-of-month is common enough that there is a method on <code>LocalDate</code> called <code>getDayOfMonth()</code>. However for more unusual fields it is necessary to use the field. For example, <code>date.get(ChronoField.ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH)</code>. The fields also provide access to the range of valid values. </p> <h2>Adjustment and Query</h2> <p> A key part of the date-time problem space is adjusting a date to a new, related value, such as the "last day of the month", or "next Wednesday". These are modeled as functions that adjust a base date-time. The functions implement <a href="temporaladjuster"><code>TemporalAdjuster</code></a> and operate on <code>Temporal</code>. A set of common functions are provided in <a href="temporaladjusters"><code>TemporalAdjusters</code></a>. For example, to find the first occurrence of a day-of-week after a given date, use <a href="temporaladjusters#next-java.time.DayOfWeek-"><code>TemporalAdjusters.next(DayOfWeek)</code></a>, such as <code>date.with(next(MONDAY))</code>. Applications can also define adjusters by implementing <a href="temporaladjuster"><code>TemporalAdjuster</code></a>. </p> <p> The <a href="temporalamount"><code>TemporalAmount</code></a> interface models amounts of relative time. </p> <p> In addition to adjusting a date-time, an interface is provided to enable querying via <a href="temporalquery"><code>TemporalQuery</code></a>. The most common implementations of the query interface are method references. The <code>from(TemporalAccessor)</code> methods on major classes can all be used, such as <code>LocalDate::from</code> or <code>Month::from</code>. Further implementations are provided in <a href="temporalqueries"><code>TemporalQueries</code></a> as static methods. Applications can also define queries by implementing <a href="temporalquery"><code>TemporalQuery</code></a>. </p> <h2>Weeks</h2> <p> Different locales have different definitions of the week. For example, in Europe the week typically starts on a Monday, while in the US it starts on a Sunday. The <a href="weekfields"><code>WeekFields</code></a> class models this distinction. </p> <p> The ISO calendar system defines an additional week-based division of years. This defines a year based on whole Monday to Monday weeks. This is modeled in <a href="isofields"><code>IsoFields</code></a>. </p> <h2>Package specification</h2> <p> Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a constructor or method in any class or interface in this package will cause a <a href="../../lang/nullpointerexception"><code>NullPointerException</code></a> to be thrown. The Javadoc "@param" definition is used to summarise the null-behavior. The "@throws <a href="../../lang/nullpointerexception"><code>NullPointerException</code></a>" is not explicitly documented in each method. </p> <p> All calculations should check for numeric overflow and throw either an <a href="../../lang/arithmeticexception"><code>ArithmeticException</code></a> or a <a href="../datetimeexception"><code>DateTimeException</code></a>. </p>
