<p>A set of date fields that provide access to Julian Days. </p>
<p> The Julian Day is a standard way of expressing date and time commonly used in the scientific community. It is expressed as a decimal number of whole days where days start at midday. This class represents variations on Julian Days that count whole days from midnight. </p>
<p> The fields are implemented relative to <a href="chronofield#EPOCH_DAY"><code>EPOCH_DAY</code></a>. The fields are supported, and can be queried and set if <code>EPOCH_DAY</code> is available. The fields work with all chronologies.</p>

<p>Julian Day field. </p>
<p> This is an integer-based version of the Julian Day Number. Julian Day is a well-known system that represents the count of whole days since day 0, which is defined to be January 1, 4713 BCE in the Julian calendar, and -4713-11-24 Gregorian. The field has "JulianDay" as 'name', and 'DAYS' as 'baseUnit'. The field always refers to the local date-time, ignoring the offset or zone. </p>
<p> For date-times, 'JULIAN_DAY.getFrom()' assumes the same value from midnight until just before the next midnight. When 'JULIAN_DAY.adjustInto()' is applied to a date-time, the time of day portion remains unaltered. 'JULIAN_DAY.adjustInto()' and 'JULIAN_DAY.getFrom()' only apply to <code>Temporal</code> objects that can be converted into <a href="chronofield#EPOCH_DAY"><code>ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY</code></a>. An <a href="unsupportedtemporaltypeexception"><code>UnsupportedTemporalTypeException</code></a> is thrown for any other type of object. </p>
<p> In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a Julian Day field. In <a href="../format/resolverstyle#STRICT">strict mode</a> and <a href="../format/resolverstyle#SMART">smart mode</a> the Julian Day value is validated against the range of valid values. In <a href="../format/resolverstyle#LENIENT">lenient mode</a> no validation occurs. </p>
<h2>Astronomical and Scientific Notes</h2> The standard astronomical definition uses a fraction to indicate the time-of-day, thus 3.25 would represent the time 18:00, since days start at midday. This implementation uses an integer and days starting at midnight. The integer value for the Julian Day Number is the astronomical Julian Day value at midday of the date in question. This amounts to the astronomical Julian Day, rounded to an integer <code>JDN = floor(JD + 0.5)</code>. <pre data-language="java">| ISO date          |  Julian Day Number | Astronomical Julian Day |

<p>Modified Julian Day field. </p>
<p> This is an integer-based version of the Modified Julian Day Number. Modified Julian Day (MJD) is a well-known system that counts days continuously. It is defined relative to astronomical Julian Day as <code>MJD = JD - 2400000.5</code>. Each Modified Julian Day runs from midnight to midnight. The field always refers to the local date-time, ignoring the offset or zone. </p>
<p> For date-times, 'MODIFIED_JULIAN_DAY.getFrom()' assumes the same value from midnight until just before the next midnight. When 'MODIFIED_JULIAN_DAY.adjustInto()' is applied to a date-time, the time of day portion remains unaltered. 'MODIFIED_JULIAN_DAY.adjustInto()' and 'MODIFIED_JULIAN_DAY.getFrom()' only apply to <code>Temporal</code> objects that can be converted into <a href="chronofield#EPOCH_DAY"><code>ChronoField.EPOCH_DAY</code></a>. An <a href="unsupportedtemporaltypeexception"><code>UnsupportedTemporalTypeException</code></a> is thrown for any other type of object. </p>
<p> This implementation is an integer version of MJD with the decimal part rounded to floor. </p>
<p> In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a Modified Julian Day field. In <a href="../format/resolverstyle#STRICT">strict mode</a> and <a href="../format/resolverstyle#SMART">smart mode</a> the Modified Julian Day value is validated against the range of valid values.
