<p>Localized definitions of the day-of-week, week-of-month and week-of-year fields. </p>
<p> A standard week is seven days long, but cultures have different definitions for some other aspects of a week. This class represents the definition of the week, for the purpose of providing <a href="temporalfield"><code>TemporalField</code></a> instances. </p>
<p> WeekFields provides five fields, <a href="weekfields#dayOfWeek--"><code>dayOfWeek()</code></a>, <a href="weekfields#weekOfMonth--"><code>weekOfMonth()</code></a>, <a href="weekfields#weekOfYear--"><code>weekOfYear()</code></a>, <a href="weekfields#weekOfWeekBasedYear--"><code>weekOfWeekBasedYear()</code></a>, and <a href="weekfields#weekBasedYear--"><code>weekBasedYear()</code></a> that provide access to the values from any <a href="temporal">temporal object</a>. </p>
<p> The computations for day-of-week, week-of-month, and week-of-year are based on the <a href="chronofield#YEAR">proleptic-year</a>, <a href="chronofield#MONTH_OF_YEAR">month-of-year</a>, <a href="chronofield#DAY_OF_MONTH">day-of-month</a>, and <a href="chronofield#DAY_OF_WEEK">ISO day-of-week</a> which are based on the <a href="chronofield#EPOCH_DAY">epoch-day</a> and the chronology. The values may not be aligned with the <a href="chronofield#YEAR_OF_ERA">year-of-Era</a> depending on the Chronology. </p>
<p>A week is defined by: </p>
<ul> <li>The first day-of-week. For example, the ISO-8601 standard considers Monday to be the first day-of-week. </li>
<li>The minimal number of days in the first week. For example, the ISO-8601 standard counts the first week as needing at least 4 days. </li>
</ul> Together these two values allow a year or month to be divided into weeks. <h2>Week of Month</h2> One field is used: week-of-month. The calculation ensures that weeks never overlap a month boundary. The month is divided into periods where each period starts on the defined first day-of-week. The earliest period is referred to as week 0 if it has less than the minimal number of days and week 1 if it has at least the minimal number of days. <table style="text-align: left; width: 50%;"> <caption>Examples of WeekFields</caption> <tr>

The year is divided into periods where each period starts on the defined first day-of-week. The earliest period is referred to as week 0 if it has less than the minimal number of days and week 1 if it has at least the minimal number of days. <h2>Week Based Year</h2> Two fields are used for week-based-year, one for the <a href="weekfields#weekOfWeekBasedYear--"><code>week-of-week-based-year</code></a> and one for <a href="weekfields#weekBasedYear--"><code>week-based-year</code></a>. In a week-based-year, each week belongs to only a single year. Week 1 of a year is the first week that starts on the first day-of-week and has at least the minimum number of days. The first and last weeks of a year may contain days from the previous calendar year or next calendar year respectively. <table style="text-align: left; width: 50%;"> <caption>Examples of WeekFields for week-based-year</caption> <tr>

<p>The ISO-8601 definition, where a week starts on Monday and the first week has a minimum of 4 days. </p>
<p> The ISO-8601 standard defines a calendar system based on weeks. It uses the week-based-year and week-of-week-based-year concepts to split up the passage of days instead of the standard year/month/day. </p>
<p> Note that the first week may start in the previous calendar year. Note also that the first few days of a calendar year may be in the week-based-year corresponding to the previous calendar year.</p>
</div>    <h3 id="SUNDAY_START">SUNDAY_START</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final WeekFields SUNDAY_START</pre> <div>
<p>The common definition of a week that starts on Sunday and the first week has a minimum of 1 day. </p>
<p> Defined as starting on Sunday and with a minimum of 1 day in the month. This week definition is in use in the US and other European countries.</p>
</div>    <h3 id="WEEK_BASED_YEARS">WEEK_BASED_YEARS</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final TemporalUnit WEEK_BASED_YEARS</pre> <div>
<p>The unit that represents week-based-years for the purpose of addition and subtraction. </p>
<p> This allows a number of week-based-years to be added to, or subtracted from, a date. The unit is equal to either 52 or 53 weeks. The estimated duration of a week-based-year is the same as that of a standard ISO year at <code>365.2425 Days</code>. </p>
<p> The rules for addition add the number of week-based-years to the existing value for the week-based-year field retaining the week-of-week-based-year and day-of-week, unless the week number it too large for the target year. In that case, the week is set to the last week of the year with the same day-of-week. </p>
<p> This unit is an immutable and thread-safe singleton.</p>
</div>     <h2 id="method.detail">Methods</h2>   <h3 id="of-java.util.Locale-">of</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static WeekFields of(Locale locale)</pre> <div>
<p>Obtains an instance of <code>WeekFields</code> appropriate for a locale. </p>
<p> This will look up appropriate values from the provider of localization data.</p>
</div> <dl> <dt>Parameters:</dt> <dd>
<code>locale</code> - the locale to use, not null</dd> <dt>Returns:</dt> <dd>the week-definition, not null</dd> </dl>    <h3 id="of-java.time.DayOfWeek-int-">of</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static WeekFields of(DayOfWeek firstDayOfWeek,
                            int minimalDaysInFirstWeek)</pre> <div>
<p>Obtains an instance of <code>WeekFields</code> from the first day-of-week and minimal days. </p>
<p> The first day-of-week defines the ISO <code>DayOfWeek</code> that is day 1 of the week. The minimal number of days in the first week defines how many days must be present in a month or year, starting from the first day-of-week, before the week is counted as the first week. A value of 1 will count the first day of the month or year as part of the first week, whereas a value of 7 will require the whole seven days to be in the new month or year. </p>
<p> WeekFields instances are singletons; for each unique combination of <code>firstDayOfWeek</code> and <code>minimalDaysInFirstWeek</code> the the same instance will be returned.</p>
</div> <dl> <dt>Parameters:</dt> <dd>
<code>firstDayOfWeek</code> - the first day of the week, not null</dd> <dd>
<code>minimalDaysInFirstWeek</code> - the minimal number of days in the first week, from 1 to 7</dd> <dt>Returns:</dt> <dd>the week-definition, not null</dd> <dt>Throws:</dt> <dd>
<code><a href="../../lang/illegalargumentexception">IllegalArgumentException</a></code> - if the minimal days value is less than one or greater than 7</dd> </dl>    <h3 id="getFirstDayOfWeek--">getFirstDayOfWeek</h3> <pre data-language="java">public DayOfWeek getFirstDayOfWeek()</pre> <div>
<p>Gets the first day-of-week. </p>
<p> The first day-of-week varies by culture. For example, the US uses Sunday, while France and the ISO-8601 standard use Monday. This method returns the first day using the standard <code>DayOfWeek</code> enum.</p>
</div> <dl> <dt>Returns:</dt> <dd>the first day-of-week, not null</dd> </dl>    <h3 id="getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek--">getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek</h3> <pre data-language="java">public int getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()</pre> <div>
<p>Gets the minimal number of days in the first week. </p>
<p> The number of days considered to define the first week of a month or year varies by culture. For example, the ISO-8601 requires 4 days (more than half a week) to be present before counting the first week.</p>
</div> <dl> <dt>Returns:</dt> <dd>the minimal number of days in the first week of a month or year, from 1 to 7</dd> </dl>    <h3 id="dayOfWeek--">dayOfWeek</h3> <pre data-language="java">public TemporalField dayOfWeek()</pre> <div>
<p>Returns a field to access the day of week based on this <code>WeekFields</code>. </p>
<p> This is similar to <a href="chronofield#DAY_OF_WEEK"><code>ChronoField.DAY_OF_WEEK</code></a> but uses values for the day-of-week based on this <code>WeekFields</code>. The days are numbered from 1 to 7 where the <a href="weekfields#getFirstDayOfWeek--"><code>first day-of-week</code></a> is assigned the value 1. </p>
<p> For example, if the first day-of-week is Sunday, then that will have the value 1, with other days ranging from Monday as 2 to Saturday as 7. </p>
<p> In the resolving phase of parsing, a localized day-of-week will be converted to a standardized <code>ChronoField</code> day-of-week. The day-of-week must be in the valid range 1 to 7. Other fields in this class build dates using the standardized day-of-week.</p>
</div> <dl> <dt>Returns:</dt> <dd>a field providing access to the day-of-week with localized numbering, not null</dd> </dl>    <h3 id="weekOfMonth--">weekOfMonth</h3> <pre data-language="java">public TemporalField weekOfMonth()</pre> <div>
<p>Returns a field to access the week of month based on this <code>WeekFields</code>. </p>
<p> This represents the concept of the count of weeks within the month where weeks start on a fixed day-of-week, such as Monday. This field is typically used with <a href="weekfields#dayOfWeek--"><code>dayOfWeek()</code></a>. </p>
<p> Week one (1) is the week starting on the <a href="weekfields#getFirstDayOfWeek--"><code>getFirstDayOfWeek()</code></a> where there are at least <a href="weekfields#getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek--"><code>getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()</code></a> days in the month. Thus, week one may start up to <code>minDays</code> days before the start of the month. If the first week starts after the start of the month then the period before is week zero (0). </p>
<p> For example:<br> - if the 1st day of the month is a Monday, week one starts on the 1st and there is no week zero<br> - if the 2nd day of the month is a Monday, week one starts on the 2nd and the 1st is in week zero<br> - if the 4th day of the month is a Monday, week one starts on the 4th and the 1st to 3rd is in week zero<br> - if the 5th day of the month is a Monday, week two starts on the 5th and the 1st to 4th is in week one<br> </p>
<p> This field can be used with any calendar system. </p>
<p> In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a year, week-of-month, month-of-year and day-of-week. </p>
<p> In <a href="../format/resolverstyle#STRICT">strict mode</a>, all four fields are validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-month field is validated to ensure that the resulting month is the month requested. </p>
<p> In <a href="../format/resolverstyle#SMART">smart mode</a>, all four fields are validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-month field is validated from 0 to 6, meaning that the resulting date can be in a different month to that specified. </p>
<p> In <a href="../format/resolverstyle#LENIENT">lenient mode</a>, the year and day-of-week are validated against the range of valid values. The resulting date is calculated equivalent to the following four stage approach. First, create a date on the first day of the first week of January in the requested year. Then take the month-of-year, subtract one, and add the amount in months to the date. Then take the week-of-month, subtract one, and add the amount in weeks to the date. Finally, adjust to the correct day-of-week within the localized week.</p>

<p> This field can be used with any calendar system. </p>
<p> In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a year, week-of-year and day-of-week. </p>
