 <h1 id="new-initialize-and-allocate">new, initialize and allocate</h1> <p>You create an instance of a class by invoking <code>new</code> on that class:</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">person = Person.new
</pre></div> <p>Here, <code>person</code> is an instance of <code>Person</code>.</p> <p>We can't do much with <code>person</code>, so let's add some concepts to it. A <code>Person</code> has a name and an age. In the "Everything is an object" section we said that an object has a type and responds to some methods, which is the only way to interact with objects, so we'll need both <code>name</code> and <code>age</code> methods. We will store this information in instance variables, which are always prefixed with an <em>at</em> (<code>@</code>) character. We also want a Person to come into existence with a name of our choice and an age of zero. We code the "come into existence" part with a special <code>initialize</code> method, which is normally called a <em>constructor</em>:</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">class Person
  def initialize(name : String)
    @name = name
    @age = 0
  end

  def name
    @name
  end

  def age
    @age
  end
end
</pre></div> <p>Now we can create people like this:</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">john = Person.new "John"
peter = Person.new "Peter"

john.name # =&gt; "John"
john.age  # =&gt; 0

peter.name # =&gt; "Peter"
</pre></div> <p>(If you wonder why we needed to specify that <code>name</code> is a <code>String</code> but we didn't need to do it for <code>age</code>, check the <a href="type_inference">global type inference algorithm</a>)</p> <p>Note that we create a <code>Person</code> with <code>new</code> but we defined the initialization in an <code>initialize</code> method, not in a <code>new</code> method. Why is this so?</p> <p>The answer is that when we defined an <code>initialize</code> method Crystal defined a <code>new</code> method for us, like this:</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">class Person
  def self.new(name : String)
    instance = Person.allocate
    instance.initialize(name)
    instance
  end
end
</pre></div> <p>First, note the <code>self.new</code> notation. This is a <a href="class_methods">class method</a> that belongs to the <strong>class</strong> <code>Person</code>, not to particular instances of that class. This is why we can do <code>Person.new</code>.</p> <p>Second, <code>allocate</code> is a low-level class method that creates an uninitialized object of the given type. It basically allocates the necessary memory for the object, then <code>initialize</code> is invoked on it and finally the instance is returned. You generally never invoke <code>allocate</code>, as it is <a href="unsafe">unsafe</a>, but that's the reason why <code>new</code> and <code>initialize</code> are related.</p><div class="_attribution">
