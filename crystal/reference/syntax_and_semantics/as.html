 <h1 id="as">as</h1> <p>The <code>as</code> pseudo-method restricts the types of an expression. For example:</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">if some_condition
  a = 1
else
  a = "hello"
end

# a : Int32 | String
</pre></div> <p>In the above code, <code>a</code> is a union of <code>Int32 | String</code>. If for some reason we are sure <code>a</code> is an <code>Int32</code> after the <code>if</code>, we can force the compiler to treat it like one:</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">a_as_int = a.as(Int32)
a_as_int.abs # works, compiler knows that a_as_int is Int32
</pre></div> <p>The <code>as</code> pseudo-method performs a runtime check: if <code>a</code> wasn't an <code>Int32</code>, an <a href="exception_handling">exception</a> is raised.</p> <p>The argument to the expression is a <a href="type_grammar">type</a>.</p> <p>If it is impossible for a type to be restricted by another type, a compile-time error is issued:</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">1.as(String) # Compile-time error
</pre></div> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>You can't use <code>as</code> to convert a type to an unrelated type: <code>as</code> is not like a <code>cast</code> in other languages. Methods on integers, floats and chars are provided for these conversions. Alternatively, use pointer casts as explained below.</p> </div> <h2 id="converting-between-pointer-types">Converting between pointer types</h2> <p>The <code>as</code> pseudo-method also allows to cast between pointer types:</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">ptr = Pointer(Int32).malloc(1)
ptr.as(Int8*) # :: Pointer(Int8)
</pre></div> <p>In this case, no runtime checks are done: pointers are unsafe and this type of casting is usually only needed in C bindings and low-level code.</p> <h2 id="converting-between-pointer-types-and-other-types">Converting between pointer types and other types</h2> <p>Conversion between pointer types and Reference types is also possible:</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">array = [1, 2, 3]

# object_id returns the address of an object in memory,
# so we create a pointer with that address
ptr = Pointer(Void).new(array.object_id)

# Now we cast that pointer to the same type, and
# we should get the same value
array2 = ptr.as(Array(Int32))
array2.same?(array) # =&gt; true
</pre></div> <p>No runtime checks are performed in these cases because, again, pointers are involved. The need for this cast is even more rare than the previous one, but allows to implement some core types (like String) in Crystal itself, and it also allows passing a Reference type to C functions by casting it to a void pointer.</p> <h2 id="usage-for-casting-to-a-bigger-type">Usage for casting to a bigger type</h2> <p>The <code>as</code> pseudo-method can be used to cast an expression to a "bigger" type. For example:</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">a = 1
b = a.as(Int32 | Float64)
b # :: Int32 | Float64
</pre></div> <p>The above might not seem to be useful, but it is when, for example, mapping an array of elements:</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">ary = [1, 2, 3]

# We want to create an array 1, 2, 3 of Int32 | Float64
ary2 = ary.map { |x| x.as(Int32 | Float64) }

ary2        # :: Array(Int32 | Float64)
ary2 &lt;&lt; 1.5 # OK
</pre></div> <p>The <code>Array#map</code> method uses the block's type as the generic type for the Array. Without the <code>as</code> pseudo-method, the inferred type would have been <code>Int32</code> and we wouldn't have been able to add a <code>Float64</code> into it.</p> <h2 id="usage-for-when-the-compiler-cant-infer-the-type-of-a-block">Usage for when the compiler can't infer the type of a block</h2> <p>Sometimes the compiler can't infer the type of a block. This can happen in recursive calls that depend on each other. In those cases you can use <code>as</code> to let it know the type:</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">some_call { |v| v.method.as(ExpectedType) }
