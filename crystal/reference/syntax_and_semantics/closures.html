 <h1 id="closures">Closures</h1> <p>Captured blocks and proc literals closure local variables and <code>self</code>. This is better understood with an example:</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">x = 0
proc = -&gt;{ x += 1; x }
proc.call # =&gt; 1
proc.call # =&gt; 2
x         # =&gt; 2
</pre></div> <p>Or with a proc returned from a method:</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">def counter
  x = 0
  -&gt;{ x += 1; x }
end

proc = counter
proc.call # =&gt; 1
proc.call # =&gt; 2
</pre></div> <p>In the above example, even though <code>x</code> is a local variable, it was captured by the proc literal. In this case the compiler allocates <code>x</code> on the heap and uses it as the context data of the proc to make it work, because normally local variables live in the stack and are gone after a method returns.</p> <h2 id="type-of-closured-variables">Type of closured variables</h2> <p>The compiler is usually moderately smart about the type of local variables. For example:</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">def foo
  yield
end

x = 1
foo do
  x = "hello"
end
x # : Int32 | String
</pre></div> <p>The compiler knows that after the block, <code>x</code> can be Int32 or String (it could know that it will always be String because the method always yields; this may improve in the future).</p> <p>If <code>x</code> is assigned something else after the block, the compiler knows the type changed:</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">x = 1
foo do
  x = "hello"
end
x # : Int32 | String

x = 'a'
x # : Char
</pre></div> <p>However, if <code>x</code> is closured by a proc, the type is always the mixed type of all assignments to it:</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">def capture(&amp;block)
  block
end

x = 1
capture { x = "hello" }

x = 'a'
x # : Int32 | String | Char
</pre></div> <p>This is because the captured block could have been potentially stored in a class or instance variable and invoked in a separate thread in between the instructions. The compiler doesn't do an exhaustive analysis of this: it just assumes that if a variable is captured by a proc, the time of that proc invocation is unknown.</p> <p>This also happens with regular proc literals, even if it's evident that the proc wasn't invoked or stored:</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">def capture(&amp;block)
  block
end

x = 1
-&gt;{ x = "hello" }

x = 'a'
x # : Int32 | String | Char
