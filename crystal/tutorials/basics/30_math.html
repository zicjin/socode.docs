 <h1 id="math">Math</h1> <h2 id="numeric-types">Numeric types</h2> <p>The two most common number types are <code>Int32</code> and <code>Float64</code>. The number in the name denotes the size in bits: <code>Int32</code> is a 32-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_(computer_science)">integer type</a>, <code>Float64</code> is a 64-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic">floating point number</a>.</p> <ul> <li>An integer literal is written as a series of one or more base-10 digits (<code>0-9</code>) without leading zeros. The default type is <code>Int32</code>.</li> <li>A floating-point literal is written as a series of two or more base-10 digits (<code>0-9</code>) with a point (<code>.</code>) somewhere in the middle, indicating the decimal point. The default type is <code>Float64</code>.</li> </ul> <p>All numeric types allow underscores at any place in the middle. This is useful to write large numbers in a more readable way: <code>100000</code> can be written as <code>100_000</code>.</p> <div class="crystal-play highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">p! 1, typeof(1)
p! 1.0, typeof(1.0)
p! 100_000, typeof(100_000)
p! 100_000.0, typeof(100_000.0)
</pre></div> <p>Float values print with a decimal point. Integer values don't.</p> <div class="admonition info"> <p class="admonition-title">Info</p> <p>There are quite a few more numeric types, but most of them are intended only for special use cases such as binary protocols, specific numeric algorithms, and performance optimization. You probably don't need them for everyday programs.</p> <p>See <a href="../../syntax_and_semantics/literals/integers">Integer literal reference</a> and <a href="../../syntax_and_semantics/literals/floats">Float literal reference</a> for a full reference on all primitive number types and alternative representations.</p> </div> <h2 id="arithmetic">Arithmetic</h2> <h3 id="equality-and-comparison">Equality and Comparison</h3> <p>Numbers of the same numerical value are considered equal regarding the equality operator <code>==</code>, independent of their type.</p> <div class="crystal-play highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">p! 1 == 1,
  1 == 2,
  1.0 == 1,
  -2000.0 == -2000
</pre></div> <p>Besides the equality operator, there are also comparison operators. They determine the relationship between two values. As with equality, comparability is also independent of type.</p> <div class="crystal-play highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">p! 2 &gt; 1,
  1 &gt;= 1,
  1 &lt; 2,
  1 &lt;= 2
</pre></div> <p>The universal comparison operator is <code>&lt;=&gt;</code>, also called <em>Spaceship operator</em> for its appearance. It compares its operands and returns a value that is either zero (both operands are equal), a positive value (the first operand is bigger), or a negative value (the second operand is bigger). It combines the behaviour of all other comparison operators.</p> <div class="crystal-play highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">p! 1 &lt;=&gt; 1,
  2 &lt;=&gt; 1,
  1 &lt;=&gt; 2
</pre></div> <h3 id="operators">Operators</h3> <p>Basic arithmetic operations can be performed with operators. Most operators are <em>binary</em> (i.e. two operands), and written in infix notation (i.e. between the operands). Some operators are <em>unary</em> (i.e. one operand), and written in prefix notation (i.e. before the operand). The value of the expression is the result of the operation.</p> <div class="crystal-play highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">p! 1 + 1, # addition
  1 - 1,  # subtraction
  2 * 3,  # multiplication
  2 ** 4, # exponentiation
  2 / 3,  # division
  2 // 3, # floor division
  3 % 2,  # modulus
  -1      # negation (unary)
</pre></div> <p>As you can see, the result of most of these operations between integer operands is also an integer value. The division operator (<code>/</code>) is an exception. It always returns a float value. The floor division operator (<code>//</code>) however returns an integer value, but it's obviously reduced to integer precision. An operation between integer and float operands always returns a float value. Otherwise, the return type is usually the type of the first operand.</p> <div class="admonition info"> <p class="admonition-title">Info</p> <p>A full list of operators is available in <a href="../../syntax_and_semantics/operators#arithmetic-operators">the Operator reference</a>.</p> </div> <h4 id="precedence">Precedence</h4> <p>When several operators are combined, the question arises in which order are they executed. In math, there are several rules, like multiplication and division taking precedence over addition and subtraction. Crystal operators implement these precedence rules.</p> <p>A tool to structure operations are parentheses. An operator expression in parentheses always takes precedence over external operators.</p> <div class="crystal-play highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">p! 4 + 5 * 2,
  (4 + 5) * 2
