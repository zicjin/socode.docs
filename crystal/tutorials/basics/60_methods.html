 <h1 id="methods">Methods</h1> <p>To avoid duplication of the same message, instead of using a variable we can define a method and call it multiple times.</p> <p>A method definition is indicated by the keyword <code>def</code> followed by the method name. Every expression until the keyword <code>end</code> is part of the method body.</p> <div class="crystal-play highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">def say_hello
  puts "Hello Penny!"
end

say_hello
say_hello
say_hello() # syntactically equivalent method call with parentheses
</pre></div> <div class="admonition tip"> <p class="admonition-title">Tip</p> <p>Method calls are unambiguously indicated by parentheses after the name, but they can be omitted. It would only be necessary for disambiguation, for example, if <code>say_hello</code> was also a local variable.</p> </div> <h2 id="arguments">Arguments</h2> <p>What if we want to greet different people, but all in the same manner? Instead of writing individual messages, we can define a method that allows customization through a parameter. A parameter is like a local variable inside the method body. Parameters are declared after the method name in parentheses. When calling a method, you can pass in arguments that are mapped as values for the method's parameters.</p> <div class="crystal-play highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">def say_hello(recipient)
  puts "Hello #{recipient}!"
end

say_hello "World"
say_hello "Crystal"
</pre></div> <div class="admonition tip"> <p class="admonition-title">Tip</p> <p>Arguments at method calls are typically placed in parentheses, but it can often be omitted. <code>say_hello "World"</code> and <code>say_hello("World")</code> are syntactically equivalent.</p> <p>It's generally recommended to use parentheses because it avoids ambiguity. But they're often omitted if the expression reads like natural language.</p> </div> <h3 id="default-arguments">Default arguments</h3> <p>Arguments can be assigned a default value. It is used in case the argument is missing in the method call. Usually, arguments are mandatory but when there's a default value, it can be omitted.</p> <div class="crystal-play highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">def say_hello(recipient = "World")
  puts "Hello #{recipient}!"
end

say_hello
say_hello "Crystal"
</pre></div> <h2 id="type-restrictions">Type Restrictions</h2> <p>Our example method expects <code>recipient</code> to be a <code>String</code>. But any other type would work as well. Try <code>say_hello 6</code> for example.</p> <p>This isn't necessarily a problem for this method. Using any other type would be valid code. But semantically we want to greet people with a name as a <code>String</code>.</p> <p>Type restrictions limit the allowed type of an argument. They come after the argument name, separated by a colon:</p> <div class="crystal-play highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">def say_hello(recipient : String)
  puts "Hello #{recipient}!"
end

say_hello "World"
say_hello "Crystal"

# Now this expression doesn't compile:
# say_hello 6
</pre></div> <p>Now names cannot be numbers or other data types anymore. This doesn't mean you can't greet people with a number as a name. The number just needs to be expressed as a string. Try <code>say_hello "6"</code> for example.</p> <h2 id="overloading">Overloading</h2> <p>Restricting the type of an argument can be used for positional overloading. When a method has an unrestricted argument like <code>say_hello(recipient)</code>, <em>all</em> calls to a method <code>say_hello</code> go to that method. But with overloading several methods of the same name can exist with different argument type restrictions. Each call is routed to the most fitting overload.</p> <div class="crystal-play highlight"><pre data-language="crystal"># This methods greets *recipient*.
def say_hello(recipient : String)
  puts "Hello #{recipient}!"
end

# This method greets *times* times.
def say_hello(times : Int32)
  puts "Hello " * times
end

say_hello "World"
say_hello 3
</pre></div> <p>Overloading isn't defined just by type restrictions. The number of arguments as well as named arguments are also relevant characteristics.</p><div class="_attribution">
