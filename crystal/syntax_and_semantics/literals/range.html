 <h1 id="range">Range</h1> <p>A <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.5.0/Range.html">Range</a> represents an interval between two values. It is typically constructed with a range literal, consisting of two or three dots:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>x..y</code>: Two dots denote an inclusive range, including <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> and all values in between (in mathematics: <code>[x, y]</code>) .</li> <li>
<code>x...y</code>: Three dots denote an exclusive range, including <code>x</code> and all values up to but not including <code>y</code> (in mathematics: <code>[x, y)</code>).</li> </ul> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">(0..5).to_a  # =&gt; [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
(0...5).to_a # =&gt; [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
</pre></div> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>Range literals are often wrapped in parentheses, for example if it is meant to be used as the receiver of a call. <code>0..5.to_a</code> without parentheses would be semantically equivalent to <code>0..(5.to_a)</code> because method calls and other operators have higher precedence than the range literal.</p> </div> <p>An easy way to remember which one is inclusive and which one is exclusive it to think of the extra dot as if it pushes <em>y</em> further away, thus leaving it outside of the range.</p> <p>The literal <code>x..y</code> is semantically equivalent to the explicit constructor <code>Range.new(x, y)</code> and <code>x...y</code> to <code>Range.new(x, y, true)</code>.</p> <p>The begin and end values do not necessarily need to be of the same type: <code>true..1</code> is a valid range, although pretty useless since <code>Enumerable</code> methods won't work with incompatible types. They need at least to be comparable.</p> <p>Ranges that begin with <code>nil</code> are called begin-less ranges, while ranges that end with <code>nil</code> are called end-less ranges. In the literal notation, <code>nil</code> can be omitted: <code>x..</code> is an end-less range starting from <code>x</code>, and <code>..x</code> is an begin-less range ending at <code>x</code>.</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">numbers = [1, 10, 3, 4, 5, 8]
numbers.select(6..) # =&gt; [10, 8]
numbers.select(..6) # =&gt; [1, 3, 4, 5]

numbers[2..] = [3, 4, 5, 8]
numbers[..2] = [1, 10, 3]
</pre></div> <p>A range that is both begin-less and end-less is valid and can be expressed as <code>..</code> or <code>...</code> but it's typically not very useful.</p><div class="_attribution">
