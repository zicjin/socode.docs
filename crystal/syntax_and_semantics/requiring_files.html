 <h1 id="requiring-files">Requiring files</h1> <p>Writing a program in a single file is OK for little snippets and small benchmark code. Big programs are better maintained and understood when split across different files.</p> <p>To make the compiler process other files you use <code>require "..."</code>. It accepts a single argument, a string literal, and it can come in many flavors.</p> <p>Once a file is required, the compiler remembers its absolute path and later <code>require</code>s of that same file will be ignored.</p> <h2 id="require-filename">require "filename"</h2> <p>This looks up "filename" in the require path.</p> <p>By default, the require path includes two locations:</p> <ul> <li>the <code>lib</code> directory relative to the current working directory (this is where dependencies are looked up)</li> <li>the location of the standard library that comes with the compiler</li> </ul> <p>These are the only places that are looked up.</p> <p>The exact paths used by the compiler can be queried as <code>crystal env CRYSTAL_PATH</code>:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">$ crystal env CRYSTAL_PATH
lib:/usr/bin/../share/crystal/src
</pre></div> <p>These lookup paths can be overridden by defining the <a href="../using_the_compiler/index#environment-variables"><code>CRYSTAL_PATH</code> environment variable</a>.</p> <p>The lookup goes like this:</p> <ul> <li>If a file named "filename.cr" is found in the require path, it is required.</li> <li>If a directory named "filename" is found and it contains a file named "filename.cr" directly underneath it, it is required.</li> <li>If a directory named "filename" is found with a directory "src" in it and it contains a file named "filename.cr" directly underneath it, it is required.</li> <li>Otherwise a compile-time error is issued.</li> </ul> <p>The second rule means that in addition to having this:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">- project
  - src
    - file
      - sub1.cr
      - sub2.cr
    - file.cr (requires "./file/*")
</pre></div> <p>you can have it like this:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">- project
  - src
    - file
      - file.cr (requires "./*")
      - sub1.cr
      - sub2.cr
</pre></div> <p>which might be a bit cleaner depending on your taste.</p> <p>The third rule is very convenient because of the typical directory structure of a project:</p> <div class="highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">- project
  - lib
    - foo
      - src
        - foo.cr
    - bar
      - src
        - bar.cr
  - src
    - project.cr
  - spec
    - project_spec.cr
</pre></div> <p>That is, inside "lib/{project}" each project's directory exists (<code>src</code>, <code>spec</code>, <code>README.md</code> and so on)</p> <p>For example, if you put <code>require "foo"</code> in <code>project.cr</code> and run <code>crystal src/project.cr</code> in the project's root directory, it will find <code>foo</code> in <code>lib/foo/foo.cr</code>.</p> <p>The fourth rule is the second rule applied to the third rule.</p> <p>If you run the compiler from somewhere else, say the <code>src</code> folder, <code>lib</code> will not be in the path and <code>require "foo"</code> can't be resolved.</p> <h2 id="require-filename_1">require "./filename"</h2> <p>This looks up "filename" relative to the file containing the require expression.</p> <p>The lookup goes like this:</p> <ul> <li>If a file named "filename.cr" is found relative to the current file, it is required.</li> <li>If a directory named "filename" is found and it contains a file named "filename.cr" directly underneath it, it is required.</li> <li>Otherwise a compile-time error is issued.</li> </ul> <p>This relative is mostly used inside a project to refer to other files inside it. It is also used to refer to code from <a href="../guides/testing">specs</a>:</p> <div class="crystal highlight"><pre data-language="crystal">require "../src/project"
</pre></div> <h2 id="other-forms">Other forms</h2> <p>In both cases you can use nested names and they will be looked up in nested directories:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>require "foo/bar/baz"</code> will lookup "foo/bar/baz.cr", "foo/bar/baz/baz.cr", "foo/src/bar/baz.cr" or "foo/src/bar/baz/baz.cr" in the require path.</li> <li>
<code>require "./foo/bar/baz"</code> will lookup "foo/bar/baz.cr" or "foo/bar/baz/baz.cr" relative to the current file.</li> </ul> <p>You can also use "../" to access parent directories relative to the current file, so <code>require "../../foo/bar"</code> works as well.</p> <p>In all of these cases you can use the special <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> suffixes:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>require "foo/*"</code> will require all ".cr" files below the "foo" directory, but not below directories inside "foo".</li> <li>
<code>require "foo/**"</code> will require all ".cr" files below the "foo" directory, and below directories inside "foo", recursively.</li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
