<h2 id="platforms-to-try">Platforms to try</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.expo.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expo</a> is a framework of tools and services for React Native that focuses on letting you build React Native apps without ever touching Xcode or Android Studio. If you have a web development background, this might appeal to you.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/infinitered/ignite" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ignite</a> is a starter kit CLI with several React Native boilerplates. The latest, <a href="https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-bowser" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ignite Bowser</a>, uses MobX-State-Tree for state management, React Navigation, and other common libraries. It has generators for components, models, and more, and supports Expo out of the box. If you are looking for a preconfigured tech stack, Ignite could be perfect for you.</p>
