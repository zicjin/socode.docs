<h1 class="postHeaderTitle">Understanding the CLI</h1>
<p>Though you may have installed the <code>react-native-cli</code> via npm as a separate module, it is a shell for accessing the CLI embedded in the React Native of each project. Your commands and their effects are dependent on the version of the module of <code>react-native</code> in context of the project. This guide will give a brief overview of the CLI in the module.</p> <h1 id="the-local-cli">
The local CLI</h1> <p>React Native has a <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/local-cli"><code>local-cli</code></a> folder with a file named <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/local-cli/cliEntry.js"><code>cliEntry.js</code></a>. Here, the commands are read from <code>commands.js</code> and added as possible CLI commands. <em>E.G.</em> the <code>react-native link</code> command, exists in the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/local-cli/link/"><code>react-native/local-cli/link</code></a> folder, and is required in <code>commands.js</code>, which will register it as a documented command to be exposed to the CLI.</p> <h1 id="command-definitions">
Command definitions</h1> <p>At the end of each command entry is an export. The export is an object with a function to perform, description of the command, and the command name. The object structure for the <code>link</code> command looks like so:</p> <pre data-language="jsx"><span class="hljs-built_in">module</span>.exports = {
  <span class="hljs-attr">func</span>: link,
  <span class="hljs-attr">description</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'links all native dependencies'</span>,
  <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'link [packageName]'</span>,
};
</pre> <h3 id="parameters">
Parameters</h3> <p>The command name identifies the parameters that a command would expect. When the command parameter is surrounded by greater-than, less-than symbols <code>&lt; &gt;</code>, this indicates that the parameter is expected. When a parameter is surrounded by brackets <code>[ ]</code>, this indicates that the parameter is optional.</p><div class="_attribution">
