<div id="reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers" class="article"> <h1>Pattern Modifiers</h1> <p class="para"> The current possible PCRE modifiers are listed below. The names in parentheses refer to internal PCRE names for these modifiers. Spaces and newlines are ignored in modifiers, other characters cause error. </p> 
<blockquote class="blockquote"> <dl> <dt> <em class="emphasis">i</em> (<code class="literal">PCRE_CASELESS</code>)</dt> <dd> <span class="simpara"> If this modifier is set, letters in the pattern match both upper and lower case letters. </span> </dd> <dt> <em class="emphasis">m</em> (<code class="literal">PCRE_MULTILINE</code>)</dt> <dd> <span class="simpara"> By default, PCRE treats the subject string as consisting of a single "line" of characters (even if it actually contains several newlines). The "start of line" metacharacter (^) matches only at the start of the string, while the "end of line" metacharacter ($) matches only at the end of the string, or before a terminating newline (unless <em class="emphasis">D</em> modifier is set). This is the same as Perl. </span> <span class="simpara"> When this modifier is set, the "start of line" and "end of line" constructs match immediately following or immediately before any newline in the subject string, respectively, as well as at the very start and end. This is equivalent to Perl's /m modifier. If there are no "\n" characters in a subject string, or no occurrences of ^ or $ in a pattern, setting this modifier has no effect. </span> </dd> <dt> <em class="emphasis">s</em> (<code class="literal">PCRE_DOTALL</code>)</dt> <dd> <span class="simpara"> If this modifier is set, a dot metacharacter in the pattern matches all characters, including newlines. Without it, newlines are excluded. This modifier is equivalent to Perl's /s modifier. A negative class such as [^a] always matches a newline character, independent of the setting of this modifier. </span> </dd> <dt> <em class="emphasis">x</em> (<code class="literal">PCRE_EXTENDED</code>)</dt> <dd> <span class="simpara"> If this modifier is set, whitespace data characters in the pattern are totally ignored except when escaped or inside a character class, and characters between an unescaped # outside a character class and the next newline character, inclusive, are also ignored. This is equivalent to Perl's /x modifier, and makes it possible to include commentary inside complicated patterns. Note, however, that this applies only to data characters. Whitespace characters may never appear within special character sequences in a pattern, for example within the sequence (?( which introduces a conditional subpattern. </span> </dd> <dt id="reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.eval">

<strong class="warning">Warning</strong><p class="simpara">This feature was <em class="emphasis">DEPRECATED</em> in PHP 5.5.0, and <em class="emphasis">REMOVED</em> as of PHP 7.0.0.</p>
</div> <span class="simpara"> If this deprecated modifier is set, <span class="function"><a href="function.preg-replace" class="function">preg_replace()</a></span> does normal substitution of backreferences in the replacement string, evaluates it as PHP code, and uses the result for replacing the search string. Single quotes, double quotes, backslashes (<code class="literal">\</code>) and NULL chars will be escaped by backslashes in substituted backreferences. </span> <div class="caution">
<strong class="caution">Caution</strong> <p class="para"> The <span class="function"><a href="function.addslashes" class="function">addslashes()</a></span> function is run on each matched backreference before the substitution takes place. As such, when the backreference is used as a quoted string, escaped characters will be converted to literals. However, characters which are escaped, which would normally not be converted, will retain their slashes. This makes use of this modifier very complicated. </p> </div> <div class="caution">
<strong class="caution">Caution</strong> <p class="para"> Make sure that <code class="parameter">replacement</code> constitutes a valid PHP code string, otherwise PHP will complain about a parse error at the line containing <span class="function"><a href="function.preg-replace" class="function">preg_replace()</a></span>. </p> </div> <div class="caution">
<strong class="caution">Caution</strong> <p class="para"> Use of this modifier is <em class="emphasis">discouraged</em>, as it can easily introduce remote code execution vulnerabilities. To prevent these, the <span class="function"><a href="function.preg-replace-callback" class="function">preg_replace_callback()</a></span> function should be used instead: </p> <div class="informalexample"> <div class="example-contents"> <pre class="phpcode" data-language="php">&lt;?php
