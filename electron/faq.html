<h1 id="electron-faq">Electron FAQ</h1> <h2 id="why-am-i-having-trouble-installing-electron">Why am I having trouble installing Electron?</h2> <p>When running <code>npm install electron</code>, some users occasionally encounter installation errors.</p> <p>In almost all cases, these errors are the result of network problems and not actual issues with the <code>electron</code> npm package. Errors like <code>ELIFECYCLE</code>, <code>EAI_AGAIN</code>, <code>ECONNRESET</code>, and <code>ETIMEDOUT</code> are all indications of such network problems. The best resolution is to try switching networks, or wait a bit and try installing again.</p> <p>You can also attempt to download Electron directly from <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/releases">electron/electron/releases</a> if installing via <code>npm</code> is failing.</p> <h2 id="when-will-electron-upgrade-to-latest-chrome">When will Electron upgrade to latest Chrome?</h2> <p>The Chrome version of Electron is usually bumped within one or two weeks after a new stable Chrome version gets released. This estimate is not guaranteed and depends on the amount of work involved with upgrading.</p> <p>Only the stable channel of Chrome is used. If an important fix is in beta or dev channel, we will back-port it.</p> <p>For more information, please see the <a href="tutorial/security">security introduction</a>.</p> <h2 id="when-will-electron-upgrade-to-latest-nodejs">When will Electron upgrade to latest Node.js?</h2> <p>When a new version of Node.js gets released, we usually wait for about a month before upgrading the one in Electron. So we can avoid getting affected by bugs introduced in new Node.js versions, which happens very often.</p> <p>New features of Node.js are usually brought by V8 upgrades, since Electron is using the V8 shipped by Chrome browser, the shiny new JavaScript feature of a new Node.js version is usually already in Electron.</p> <h2 id="how-to-share-data-between-web-pages">How to share data between web pages?</h2> <p>To share data between web pages (the renderer processes) the simplest way is to use HTML5 APIs which are already available in browsers. Good candidates are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage">Storage API</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage"><code>localStorage</code></a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage"><code>sessionStorage</code></a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API">IndexedDB</a>.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can use the IPC primitives that are provided by Electron. To share data between the main and renderer processes, you can use the <a href="api/ipc-main"><code>ipcMain</code></a> and <a href="api/ipc-renderer"><code>ipcRenderer</code></a> modules. To communicate directly between web pages, you can send a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MessagePort"><code>MessagePort</code></a> from one to the other, possibly via the main process using <a href="api/ipc-renderer#ipcrendererpostmessagechannel-message-transfer"><code>ipcRenderer.postMessage()</code></a>. Subsequent communication over message ports is direct and does not detour through the main process.</p> <h2 id="my-apps-tray-disappeared-after-a-few-minutes">My app's tray disappeared after a few minutes.</h2> <p>This happens when the variable which is used to store the tray gets garbage collected.</p> <p>If you encounter this problem, the following articles may prove helpful:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Memory_Management">Memory Management</a></li> <li><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bzt2dkta(v=vs.94).aspx">Variable Scope</a></li> </ul> <p>If you want a quick fix, you can make the variables global by changing your code from this:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">const { app, Tray } = require('electron')
app.whenReady().then(() =&gt; {
  const tray = new Tray('/path/to/icon.png')
  tray.setTitle('hello world')
})
</pre> <p>to this:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">const { app, Tray } = require('electron')
let tray = null
app.whenReady().then(() =&gt; {
  tray = new Tray('/path/to/icon.png')
  tray.setTitle('hello world')
})
</pre> <h2 id="i-can-not-use-jqueryrequirejsmeteorangularjs-in-electron">I can not use jQuery/RequireJS/Meteor/AngularJS in Electron.</h2> <p>Due to the Node.js integration of Electron, there are some extra symbols inserted into the DOM like <code>module</code>, <code>exports</code>, <code>require</code>. This causes problems for some libraries since they want to insert the symbols with the same names.</p> <p>To solve this, you can turn off node integration in Electron:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">// In the main process.
const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')
const win = new BrowserWindow({
  webPreferences: {
    nodeIntegration: false
  }
})
win.show()
</pre> <p>But if you want to keep the abilities of using Node.js and Electron APIs, you have to rename the symbols in the page before including other libraries:</p> <pre data-language="html">&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
window.nodeRequire = require;
delete window.require;
delete window.exports;
delete window.module;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</pre> <h2 id="requireelectronxxx-is-undefined">
<code>require('electron').xxx</code> is undefined.</h2> <p>When using Electron's built-in module you might encounter an error like this:</p> <pre data-language="sh">&gt; require('electron').webFrame.setZoomFactor(1.0)
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'setZoomLevel' of undefined
</pre> <p>It is very likely you are using the module in the wrong process. For example <code>electron.app</code> can only be used in the main process, while <code>electron.webFrame</code> is only available in renderer processes.</p> <h2 id="the-font-looks-blurry-what-is-this-and-what-can-i-do">The font looks blurry, what is this and what can I do?</h2> <p>If <a href="https://alienryderflex.com/sub_pixel/">sub-pixel anti-aliasing</a> is deactivated, then fonts on LCD screens can look blurry. Example:</p> <p><img src="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/images/subpixel-rendering-screenshot.gif" alt="subpixel rendering example"></p> <p>Sub-pixel anti-aliasing needs a non-transparent background of the layer containing the font glyphs. (See <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/6344#issuecomment-420371918">this issue</a> for more info).</p> <p>To achieve this goal, set the background in the constructor for <a href="api/browser-window">BrowserWindow</a>:</p> <pre data-language="javascript">const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')
const win = new BrowserWindow({
  backgroundColor: '#fff'
})
</pre> <p>The effect is visible only on (some?) LCD screens. Even if you don't see a difference, some of your users may. It is best to always set the background this way, unless you have reasons not to do so.</p> <p>Notice that just setting the background in the CSS does not have the desired effect.</p><div class="_attribution">
