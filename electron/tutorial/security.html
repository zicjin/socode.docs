<h1 id="security-native-capabilities-and-your-responsibility">Security, Native Capabilities, and Your Responsibility</h1> <p>As web developers, we usually enjoy the strong security net of the browser - the risks associated with the code we write are relatively small. Our websites are granted limited powers in a sandbox, and we trust that our users enjoy a browser built by a large team of engineers that is able to quickly respond to newly discovered security threats.</p> <p>When working with Electron, it is important to understand that Electron is not a web browser. It allows you to build feature-rich desktop applications with familiar web technologies, but your code wields much greater power. JavaScript can access the filesystem, user shell, and more. This allows you to build high quality native applications, but the inherent security risks scale with the additional powers granted to your code.</p> <p>With that in mind, be aware that displaying arbitrary content from untrusted sources poses a severe security risk that Electron is not intended to handle. In fact, the most popular Electron apps (Atom, Slack, Visual Studio Code, etc) display primarily local content (or trusted, secure remote content without Node integration) – if your application executes code from an online source, it is your responsibility to ensure that the code is not malicious.</p> <h2 id="reporting-security-issues">Reporting Security Issues</h2> <p>For information on how to properly disclose an Electron vulnerability, see <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/master/SECURITY.md">SECURITY.md</a></p> <h2 id="chromium-security-issues-and-upgrades">Chromium Security Issues and Upgrades</h2> <p>Electron keeps up to date with alternating Chromium releases. For more information, see the <a href="https://electronjs.org/blog/12-week-cadence">Electron Release Cadence blog post</a>.</p> <h2 id="security-is-everyones-responsibility">Security Is Everyone's Responsibility</h2> <p>It is important to remember that the security of your Electron application is the result of the overall security of the framework foundation (<em>Chromium</em>, <em>Node.js</em>), Electron itself, all NPM dependencies and your code. As such, it is your responsibility to follow a few important best practices:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Keep your application up-to-date with the latest Electron framework release.</strong> When releasing your product, you’re also shipping a bundle composed of Electron, Chromium shared library and Node.js. Vulnerabilities affecting these components may impact the security of your application. By updating Electron to the latest version, you ensure that critical vulnerabilities (such as <em>nodeIntegration bypasses</em>) are already patched and cannot be exploited in your application. For more information, see "<a href="#15-use-a-current-version-of-electron">Use a current version of Electron</a>".</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Evaluate your dependencies.</strong> While NPM provides half a million reusable packages, it is your responsibility to choose trusted 3rd-party libraries. If you use outdated libraries affected by known vulnerabilities or rely on poorly maintained code, your application security could be in jeopardy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adopt secure coding practices.</strong> The first line of defense for your application is your own code. Common web vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), have a higher security impact on Electron applications hence it is highly recommended to adopt secure software development best practices and perform security testing.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="isolation-for-untrusted-content">Isolation For Untrusted Content</h2> <p>A security issue exists whenever you receive code from an untrusted source (e.g. a remote server) and execute it locally. As an example, consider a remote website being displayed inside a default <a href="../api/browser-window"><code>BrowserWindow</code></a>. If an attacker somehow manages to change said content (either by attacking the source directly, or by sitting between your app and the actual destination), they will be able to execute native code on the user's machine.</p> <blockquote> <p>⚠️ Under no circumstances should you load and execute remote code with Node.js integration enabled. Instead, use only local files (packaged together with your application) to execute Node.js code. To display remote content, use the <a href="../api/webview-tag"><code>&lt;webview&gt;</code></a> tag or <a href="../api/browser-view"><code>BrowserView</code></a>, make sure to disable the <code>nodeIntegration</code> and enable <code>contextIsolation</code>.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="electron-security-warnings">Electron Security Warnings</h2> <p>From Electron 2.0 on, developers will see warnings and recommendations printed to the developer console. They only show up when the binary's name is Electron, indicating that a developer is currently looking at the console.</p> <p>You can force-enable or force-disable these warnings by setting <code>ELECTRON_ENABLE_SECURITY_WARNINGS</code> or <code>ELECTRON_DISABLE_SECURITY_WARNINGS</code> on either <code>process.env</code> or the <code>window</code> object.</p> <h2 id="checklist-security-recommendations">Checklist: Security Recommendations</h2> <p>You should at least follow these steps to improve the security of your application:</p> <ol> <li><a href="#1-only-load-secure-content">Only load secure content</a></li> <li><a href="#2-do-not-enable-nodejs-integration-for-remote-content">Disable the Node.js integration in all renderers that display remote content</a></li> <li><a href="#3-enable-context-isolation-for-remote-content">Enable context isolation in all renderers that display remote content</a></li> <li><a href="#4-handle-session-permission-requests-from-remote-content">Use <code>ses.setPermissionRequestHandler()</code> in all sessions that load remote content</a></li> <li><a href="#5-do-not-disable-websecurity">Do not disable <code>webSecurity</code></a></li> <li>

In other words, do not use insecure protocols like <code>HTTP</code>. Similarly, we recommend the use of <code>WSS</code> over <code>WS</code>, <code>FTPS</code> over <code>FTP</code>, and so on.</p> <h3 id="why">Why?</h3> <p><code>HTTPS</code> has three main benefits:</p> <p>1) It authenticates the remote server, ensuring your app connects to the correct host instead of an impersonator. 2) It ensures data integrity, asserting that the data was not modified while in transit between your application and the host. 3) It encrypts the traffic between your user and the destination host, making it more difficult to eavesdrop on the information sent between your app and the host.</p> <h3 id="how">How?</h3> <pre data-language="js">// Bad

The goal is to limit the powers you grant to remote content, thus making it dramatically more difficult for an attacker to harm your users should they gain the ability to execute JavaScript on your website.</p> <p>After this, you can grant additional permissions for specific hosts. For example, if you are opening a BrowserWindow pointed at <code>https://example.com/</code>, you can give that website exactly the abilities it needs, but no more.</p> <h3 id="why-1">Why?</h3> <p>A cross-site-scripting (XSS) attack is more dangerous if an attacker can jump out of the renderer process and execute code on the user's computer. Cross-site-scripting attacks are fairly common - and while an issue, their power is usually limited to messing with the website that they are executed on. Disabling Node.js integration helps prevent an XSS from being escalated into a so-called "Remote Code Execution" (RCE) attack.</p> <h3 id="how-1">How?</h3> <pre data-language="js">// Bad

Preload scripts continue to have access to <code>require</code> and other Node.js features, allowing developers to expose a custom API to remotely loaded content.</p> <p>In the following example preload script, the later loaded website will have access to a <code>window.readConfig()</code> method, but no Node.js features.</p> <pre data-language="js">const { readFileSync } = require('fs')

In practice, that means that global objects like <code>Array.prototype.push</code> or <code>JSON.parse</code> cannot be modified by scripts running in the renderer process.</p> <p>Electron uses the same technology as Chromium's <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts#execution-environment">Content Scripts</a> to enable this behavior.</p> <p>Even when <code>nodeIntegration: false</code> is used, to truly enforce strong isolation and prevent the use of Node primitives <code>contextIsolation</code> <strong>must</strong> also be used.</p> <h3 id="why--how">Why &amp; How?</h3> <p>For more information on what <code>contextIsolation</code> is and how to enable it please see our dedicated <a href="context-isolation">Context Isolation</a> document.</p> <h2 id="4-handle-session-permission-requests-from-remote-content">4) Handle Session Permission Requests From Remote Content</h2> <p>You may have seen permission requests while using Chrome: They pop up whenever the website attempts to use a feature that the user has to manually approve ( like notifications).</p> <p>The API is based on the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/permissions">Chromium permissions API</a> and implements the same types of permissions.</p> <h3 id="why-2">Why?</h3> <p>By default, Electron will automatically approve all permission requests unless the developer has manually configured a custom handler.

If an attacker can convince your app to navigate away from its current page, they can possibly force your app to open web sites on the Internet. Even if your <code>webContents</code> are configured to be more secure (like having <code>nodeIntegration</code> disabled or <code>contextIsolation</code> enabled), getting your app to open a random web site will make the work of exploiting your app a lot easier.</p> <p>A common attack pattern is that the attacker convinces your app's users to interact with the app in such a way that it navigates to one of the attacker's pages.
