<h1 id="goma">Goma</h1> <blockquote> <p>Goma is a distributed compiler service for open-source projects such as Chromium and Android.</p> </blockquote> <p>Electron has a deployment of a custom Goma Backend that we make available to all Electron Maintainers. See the <a href="#access">Access</a> section below for details on authentication. There is also a <code>cache-only</code> Goma endpoint that will be used by default if you do not have credentials. Requests to the cache-only Goma will not hit our cluster, but will read from our cache and should result in significantly faster build times.</p> <h2 id="enabling-goma">Enabling Goma</h2> <p>Currently the only supported way to use Goma is to use our <a href="https://github.com/electron/build-tools">Build Tools</a>. Goma configuration is automatically included when you set up <code>build-tools</code>.</p> <p>If you are a maintainer and have access to our cluster, please ensure that you run <code>e init</code> with <code>--goma=cluster</code> in order to configure <code>build-tools</code> to use the Goma cluster. If you have an existing config, you can just set <code>"goma": "cluster"</code> in your config file.</p> <h2 id="building-with-goma">Building with Goma</h2> <p>When you are using Goma you can run <code>ninja</code> with a substantially higher <code>j</code> value than would normally be supported by your machine.</p> <p>Please do not set a value higher than <strong>200</strong> on Windows or Linux and <strong>50</strong> on macOS. We monitor Goma system usage, and users found to be abusing it with unreasonable concurrency will be de-activated.</p> <pre data-language="bash">ninja -C out/Testing electron -j 200
</pre> <p>If you're using <code>build-tools</code>, appropriate <code>-j</code> values will automatically be used for you.</p> <h2 id="monitoring-goma">Monitoring Goma</h2> <p>If you access <a href="http://localhost:8088">http://localhost:8088</a> on your local machine you can monitor compile jobs as they flow through the goma system.</p> <h2 id="access">Access</h2> <p>For security and cost reasons, access to Electron's Goma cluster is currently restricted to Electron Maintainers. If you want access please head to <code>#access-requests</code> in Slack and ping <code>@goma-squad</code> to ask for access. Please be aware that being a maintainer does not <em>automatically</em> grant access and access is determined on a case by case basis.</p> <h2 id="uptime--support">Uptime / Support</h2> <p>We have automated monitoring of our Goma cluster and cache at <a href="https://status.notgoma.com">https://status.notgoma.com</a></p> <p>We do not provide support for usage of Goma and any issues raised asking for help / having issues will <em>probably</em> be closed without much reason, we do not have the capacity to handle that kind of support.</p><div class="_attribution">
