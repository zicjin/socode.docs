<h1 id="build-system-overview">Build System Overview</h1> <p>Electron uses <a href="https://gn.googlesource.com/gn">GN</a> for project generation and <a href="https://ninja-build.org/">ninja</a> for building. Project configurations can be found in the <code>.gn</code> and <code>.gni</code> files.</p> <h2 id="gn-files">GN Files</h2> <p>The following <code>gn</code> files contain the main rules for building Electron:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>BUILD.gn</code> defines how Electron itself is built and includes the default configurations for linking with Chromium.</li> <li>
<code>build/args/{debug,release,all}.gn</code> contain the default build arguments for building Electron.</li> </ul> <h2 id="component-build">Component Build</h2> <p>Since Chromium is quite a large project, the final linking stage can take quite a few minutes, which makes it hard for development. In order to solve this, Chromium introduced the "component build", which builds each component as a separate shared library, making linking very quick but sacrificing file size and performance.</p> <p>Electron inherits this build option from Chromium. In <code>Debug</code> builds, the binary will be linked to a shared library version of Chromium's components to achieve fast linking time; for <code>Release</code> builds, the binary will be linked to the static library versions, so we can have the best possible binary size and performance.</p> <h2 id="tests">Tests</h2> <p><strong>NB</strong> <em>this section is out of date and contains information that is no longer relevant to the GN-built electron.</em></p> <p>Test your changes conform to the project coding style using:</p> <pre data-language="sh">$ npm run lint
</pre> <p>Test functionality using:</p> <pre data-language="sh">$ npm test
</pre> <p>Whenever you make changes to Electron source code, you'll need to re-run the build before the tests:</p> <pre data-language="sh">$ npm run build &amp;&amp; npm test
</pre> <p>You can make the test suite run faster by isolating the specific test or block you're currently working on using Mocha's <a href="https://mochajs.org/#exclusive-tests">exclusive tests</a> feature. Append <code>.only</code> to any <code>describe</code> or <code>it</code> function call:</p> <pre data-language="js">describe.only('some feature', () =&gt; {
  // ... only tests in this block will be run
})
</pre> <p>Alternatively, you can use mocha's <code>grep</code> option to only run tests matching the given regular expression pattern:</p> <pre data-language="sh">$ npm test -- --grep child_process
</pre> <p>Tests that include native modules (e.g. <code>runas</code>) can't be executed with the debug build (see <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/2558">#2558</a> for details), but they will work with the release build.</p> <p>To run the tests with the release build use:</p> <pre data-language="sh">$ npm test -- -R
