<h1 id="testing">Testing</h1> <p>We aim to keep the code coverage of Electron high. We ask that all pull request not only pass all existing tests, but ideally also add new tests to cover changed code and new scenarios. Ensuring that we capture as many code paths and use cases of Electron as possible ensures that we all ship apps with fewer bugs.</p> <p>This repository comes with linting rules for both JavaScript and C++ â€“ as well as unit and integration tests. To learn more about Electron's coding style, please see the <a href="coding-style">coding-style</a> document.</p> <h2 id="linting">Linting</h2> <p>To ensure that your JavaScript is in compliance with the Electron coding style, run <code>npm run lint-js</code>, which will run <code>standard</code> against both Electron itself as well as the unit tests. If you are using an editor with a plugin/addon system, you might want to use one of the many <a href="https://standardjs.com/#are-there-text-editor-plugins">StandardJS addons</a> to be informed of coding style violations before you ever commit them.</p> <p>To run <code>standard</code> with parameters, run <code>npm run lint-js --</code> followed by arguments you want passed to <code>standard</code>.</p> <p>To ensure that your C++ is in compliance with the Electron coding style, run <code>npm run lint-cpp</code>, which runs a <code>cpplint</code> script. We recommend that you use <code>clang-format</code> and prepared <a href="clang-format">a short tutorial</a>.</p> <p>There is not a lot of Python in this repository, but it too is governed by coding style rules. <code>npm run lint-py</code> will check all Python, using <code>pylint</code> to do so.</p> <h2 id="unit-tests">Unit Tests</h2> <p>If you are not using <a href="https://github.com/electron/build-tools">build-tools</a>, ensure that that name you have configured for your local build of Electron is one of <code>Testing</code>, <code>Release</code>, <code>Default</code>, <code>Debug</code>, or you have set <code>process.env.ELECTRON_OUT_DIR</code>. Without these set, Electron will fail to perform some pre-testing steps.</p> <p>To run all unit tests, run <code>npm run test</code>. The unit tests are an Electron app (surprise!) that can be found in the <code>spec</code> folder. Note that it has its own <code>package.json</code> and that its dependencies are therefore not defined in the top-level <code>package.json</code>.</p> <p>To run only specific tests matching a pattern, run <code>npm run test -- -g=PATTERN</code>, replacing the <code>PATTERN</code> with a regex that matches the tests you would like to run. As an example: If you want to run only IPC tests, you would run <code>npm run test -- -g ipc</code>.</p> <h3 id="testing-on-windows-10-devices">Testing on Windows 10 devices</h3> <h4 id="extra-steps-to-run-the-unit-test">Extra steps to run the unit test:</h4> <ol> <li> <p>Visual Studio 2019 must be installed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Node headers have to be compiled for your configuration.</p> <pre data-language="powershell">ninja -C out\Testing third_party\electron_node:headers

To install Meiryo:</p> <ol> <li>Push the Windows key and search for <em>Manage optional features</em>.</li> <li>Click <em>Add a feature</em>.</li> <li>Select <em>Japanese Supplemental Fonts</em> and click <em>Install</em>.</li> </ol> <h4 id="pixel-measurements">Pixel measurements</h4> <p>Some tests which rely on precise pixel measurements may not work correctly on devices with Hi-DPI screen settings due to floating point precision errors. To run these tests correctly, make sure the device is set to 100% scaling.</p> <p>To configure display scaling:</p> <ol> <li>Push the Windows key and search for <em>Display settings</em>.</li> <li>Under <em>Scale and layout</em>, make sure that the device is set to 100%.</li> </ol><div class="_attribution">
