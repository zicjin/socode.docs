<h1 id="build-instructions-windows">Build Instructions (Windows)</h1> <p>Follow the guidelines below for building <strong>Electron itself</strong> on Windows, for the purposes of creating custom Electron binaries. For bundling and distributing your app code with the prebuilt Electron binaries, see the <a href="../tutorial/application-distribution">application distribution</a> guide.</p> <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2> <ul> <li>Windows 10 / Server 2012 R2 or higher</li> <li>Visual Studio 2017 15.7.2 or higher - <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/">download VS 2019 Community Edition for free</a><ul> <li>See <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/windows_build_instructions.md#visual-studio">the Chromium build documentation</a> for more details on which Visual Studio components are required.</li> <li>If your Visual Studio is installed in a directory other than the default, you'll need to set a few environment variables to point the toolchains to your installation path.<ul> <li>
<code>vs2019_install = DRIVE:\path\to\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community</code>, replacing <code>2019</code> and <code>Community</code> with your installed versions and replacing <code>DRIVE:</code> with the drive that Visual Studio is on. Often, this will be <code>C:</code>.</li> <li>
<code>WINDOWSSDKDIR = DRIVE:\path\to\Windows Kits\10</code>, replacing <code>DRIVE:</code> with the drive that Windows Kits is on. Often, this will be <code>C:</code>.</li> </ul>
</li> <li>
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/#files">Python for Windows (pywin32) Extensions</a> is also needed in order to run the build process.</li> </ul>
</li> <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/download/">Node.js</a></li> <li><a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a></li> <li>Debugging Tools for Windows of Windows SDK 10.0.15063.468 if you plan on creating a full distribution since <code>symstore.exe</code> is used for creating a symbol store from <code>.pdb</code> files.<ul> <li>Different versions of the SDK can be installed side by side. To install the SDK, open Visual Studio Installer, select <code>Change</code> → <code>Individual Components</code>, scroll down and select the appropriate Windows SDK to install. Another option would be to look at the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive">Windows SDK and emulator archive</a> and download the standalone version of the SDK respectively.</li> <li>The SDK Debugging Tools must also be installed. If the Windows 10 SDK was installed via the Visual Studio installer, then they can be installed by going to: <code>Control Panel</code> → <code>Programs</code> → <code>Programs and Features</code> → Select the "Windows Software Development Kit" → <code>Change</code> → <code>Change</code> → Check "Debugging Tools For Windows" → <code>Change</code>. Or, you can download the standalone SDK installer and use it to install the Debugging Tools.</li> </ul>
</li> </ul> <p>If you don't currently have a Windows installation, <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/">dev.microsoftedge.com</a> has timebombed versions of Windows that you can use to build Electron.</p> <p>Building Electron is done entirely with command-line scripts and cannot be done with Visual Studio. You can develop Electron with any editor but support for building with Visual Studio will come in the future.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Even though Visual Studio is not used for building, it's still <strong>required</strong> because we need the build toolchains it provides.</p> <h2 id="exclude-source-tree-from-windows-security">Exclude source tree from Windows Security</h2> <p>Windows Security doesn't like one of the files in the Chromium source code (see <a href="https://crbug.com/441184">https://crbug.com/441184</a>), so it will constantly delete it, causing <code>gclient sync</code> issues. You can exclude the source tree from being monitored by Windows Security by <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26">following these instructions</a>.</p> <h2 id="building">Building</h2> <p>See <a href="build-instructions-gn">Build Instructions: GN</a></p> <h2 id="32bit-build">32bit Build</h2> <p>To build for the 32bit target, you need to pass <code>target_cpu = "x86"</code> as a GN arg. You can build the 32bit target alongside the 64bit target by using a different output directory for GN, e.g. <code>out/Release-x86</code>, with different arguments.</p> <pre data-language="powershell">$ gn gen out/Release-x86 --args="import(\"//electron/build/args/release.gn\") target_cpu=\"x86\""
</pre> <p>The other building steps are exactly the same.</p> <h2 id="visual-studio-project">Visual Studio project</h2> <p>To generate a Visual Studio project, you can pass the <code>--ide=vs2017</code> parameter to <code>gn gen</code>:</p> <pre data-language="powershell">$ gn gen out/Testing --ide=vs2017

It happens when clicking inside the prompt window with <code>QuickEdit</code> enabled and is intended to allow selecting and copying output text easily. Since each accidental click will pause the build process, you might want to disable this feature in the command prompt properties.</p><div class="_attribution">
