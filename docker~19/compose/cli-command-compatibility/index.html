<h1>Compose command compatibility with docker-compose</h1>
<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">compose</code> command in the Docker CLI supports most of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code> commands and flags. It is expected to be a drop-in replacement for <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code>. There are a few remaining flags that have yet to be implemented, and we are prioritizing these implementations based on usage metrics and user feedback.</p> <p>You can follow progress on the implementation of the remaining commands and flags in the <a href="https://github.com/docker/compose-cli/issues/1283" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_">Compose-CLI</a> GitHub repository.</p> <p>If you see some Compose functionality that is not available in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">compose</code> command, create an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/docker/compose-cli/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_">Compose-CLI</a> GitHub repository so we can prioritize it.</p> <h2 id="commands-or-flags-not-yet-implemented">Commands or flags not yet implemented</h2> <p>The following commands have not been implemented yet, and maybe implemented at a later time. Let us know if these commands are a higher priority for your usecases.</p> <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">compose build --memory</code>. This option is not yet supported by buildkit. The flag is currently supported but is hidden to avoid breaking existing Compose usage. It does not have any effect.</p> <h2 id="flags-that-will-not-be-implemented">Flags that will not be implemented</h2> <p>The list below includes the flags that we are not planning to support in Compose in the Docker CLI, either because they are already deprecated in <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code>, or because they are not relevant for Compose in the Docker CLI.</p> <ul> <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">compose ps --filter KEY-VALUE</code> Not relevant due to its complicated usage with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">service</code> command and also because it is not documented properly in <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code>.</li> <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">compose rm --all</code> Deprecated in docker-compose.</li> <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">compose scale</code> Deprecated in docker-compose (use <code class="highlighter-rouge">compose up --scale</code> instead)</li> </ul> <p>Global flags:</p> <ul> <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">compose --compatibility</code> Deprecated in docker-compose.</li> </ul>
