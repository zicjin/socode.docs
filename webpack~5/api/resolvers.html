<h1>Resolvers</h1>
<p>Resolvers are created using the <code>enhanced-resolve</code> package. The <code>Resolver</code> class extends the <code>tapable</code> class and uses <code>tapable</code> to provide a few hooks. The <code>enhanced-resolve</code> package can be used directly to create new resolvers, however any <a href="node#compiler-instance"><code>compiler</code> instance</a> has a few resolver instances that can be tapped into.</p>
<p>Before reading on, make sure to have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/webpack/enhanced-resolve"><code>enhanced-resolve</code></a> and <a href="plugins#tapable"><code>tapable</code></a> documentation.</p>
<h2 id="types">Types
</h2>
<p>There are three types of built-in resolvers available on the <code>compiler</code> class:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>normal</code>: Resolves a module via an absolute or relative path.</li>
<li>
<code>context</code>: Resolves a module within a given context.</li>
<li>
<code>loader</code>: Resolves a webpack <a href="https://webpack.js.org/loaders">loader</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on need, any one of these built-in resolvers, that are used by the <code>compiler</code>, can be customized via plugins:</p>
<pre class="hljs language-js" data-language="js">compiler.resolverFactory.hooks.resolver
  .for('[type]')
  .tap('name', (resolver) =&gt; {
    // you can tap into resolver.hooks now
    resolver.hooks.result.tap('MyPlugin', (result) =&gt; {
      return result;
    });
  });</pre>
<p>Where <code>[type]</code> is one of the three resolvers mentioned above.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/webpack/enhanced-resolve"><code>enhanced-resolve</code> documentation</a> for a full list of hooks and their description.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-options">Configuration Options
</h2>
<p>The resolvers mentioned above can also be customized via a configuration file with the <a href="../configuration/resolve"><code>resolve</code></a> or <a href="../configuration/resolve#resolveloader"><code>resolveLoader</code></a> options. These options allow users to change the resolving behavior through a variety of options including through resolve <code>plugins</code>.</p>
<p>The resolver plugins, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/shaketbaby/directory-named-webpack-plugin"><code>DirectoryNamedPlugin</code></a>, can be included directly in <code>resolve.plugins</code> rather than using directly in <a href="../configuration/plugins#plugins"><code>plugins</code> configuration option</a>.</p>
<aside class="tip"><h6 class="tip__prefix">tip</h6>
<p>Note that the <code>resolve</code> configuration affects the <code>normal</code> and <code>context</code> resolvers while <code>resolveLoader</code> is used to modify the <code>loader</code> resolver.</p></aside><div class="_attribution">
