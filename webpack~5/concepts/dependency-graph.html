<h1>Dependency Graph</h1>
<div>
<p>Any time one file depends on another, webpack treats this as a <em>dependency</em>. This allows webpack to take non-code assets, such as images or web fonts, and also provide them as <em>dependencies</em> for your application.</p> <p>When webpack processes your application, it starts from a list of modules defined on the command line or in its configuration file. Starting from these <a href="entry-points"><em>entry points</em></a>, webpack recursively builds a <em>dependency graph</em> that includes every module your application needs, then bundles all of those modules into a small number of <em>bundles</em> - often, only one - to be loaded by the browser.</p> <aside class="tip"><h6 class="tip__prefix">tip</h6>
<p>Bundling your application is especially powerful for <em>HTTP/1.1</em> clients, as it minimizes the number of times your app has to wait while the browser starts a new request. For <em>HTTP/2</em>, you can also use <a href="../guides/code-splitting">Code Splitting</a> to achieve best results.</p></aside> </div>
