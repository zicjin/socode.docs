<h1 id="graceful-shutdown-and-cleanup">Graceful Shutdown and Cleanup</h1> <p>The code in Listing 20-20 is responding to requests asynchronously through the use of a thread pool, as we intended. We get some warnings about the <code>workers</code>, <code>id</code>, and <code>thread</code> fields that we’re not using in a direct way that reminds us we’re not cleaning up anything. When we use the less elegant <span class="keystroke">ctrl-c</span> method to halt the main thread, all other threads are stopped immediately as well, even if they’re in the middle of serving a request.</p> <p>Now we’ll implement the <code>Drop</code> trait to call <code>join</code> on each of the threads in the pool so they can finish the requests they’re working on before closing. Then we’ll implement a way to tell the threads they should stop accepting new requests and shut down. To see this code in action, we’ll modify our server to accept only two requests before gracefully shutting down its thread pool.</p> <h3 id="implementing-the-drop-trait-on-threadpool">Implementing the <code id="">Drop</code> Trait on <code>ThreadPool</code>

error: could not compile `hello` due to previous error
</pre> <p>The error tells us we can’t call <code>join</code> because we only have a mutable borrow of each <code>worker</code> and <code>join</code> takes ownership of its argument. To solve this issue, we need to move the thread out of the <code>Worker</code> instance that owns <code>thread</code> so <code>join</code> can consume the thread. We did this in Listing 17-15: if <code>Worker</code> holds an <code>Option&lt;thread::JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;&gt;</code> instead, we can call the <code>take</code> method on the <code>Option</code> to move the value out of the <code>Some</code> variant and leave a <code>None</code> variant in its place. In other words, a <code>Worker</code> that is running will have a <code>Some</code> variant in <code>thread</code>, and when we want to clean up a <code>Worker</code>, we’ll replace <code>Some</code> with <code>None</code> so the <code>Worker</code> doesn’t have a thread to run.</p> <p>So we know we want to update the definition of <code>Worker</code> like this:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">use std::sync::mpsc;

We’re using <code>if let</code> to destructure the <code>Some</code> and get the thread; then we call <code>join</code> on the thread.

But the bad news is this code doesn’t function the way we want it to yet. The key is the logic in the closures run by the threads of the <code>Worker</code> instances: at the moment, we call <code>join</code>, but that won’t shut down the threads because they <code>loop</code> forever looking for jobs. If we try to drop our <code>ThreadPool</code> with our current implementation of <code>drop</code>, the main thread will block forever waiting for the first thread to finish.</p> <p>To fix this problem, we’ll modify the threads so they listen for either a <code>Job</code> to run or a signal that they should stop listening and exit the infinite loop. Instead of <code>Job</code> instances, our channel will send one of these two enum variants.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">use std::sync::mpsc;

</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 20-24: Sending <code>Message::Terminate</code> to the workers before calling <code>join</code> on each worker thread</span></p> <p>We’re now iterating over the workers twice: once to send one <code>Terminate</code> message for each worker and once to call <code>join</code> on each worker’s thread. If we tried to send a message and <code>join</code> immediately in the same loop, we couldn’t guarantee that the worker in the current iteration would be the one to get the message from the channel.</p> <p>To better understand why we need two separate loops, imagine a scenario with two workers. If we used a single loop to iterate through each worker, on the first iteration a terminate message would be sent down the channel and <code>join</code> called on the first worker’s thread. If that first worker was busy processing a request at that moment, the second worker would pick up the terminate message from the channel and shut down. We would be left waiting on the first worker to shut down, but it never would because the second thread picked up the terminate message. Deadlock!</p> <p>To prevent this scenario, we first put all of our <code>Terminate</code> messages on the channel in one loop; then we join on all the threads in another loop. Each worker will stop receiving requests on the channel once it gets a terminate message. So, we can be sure that if we send the same number of terminate messages as there are workers, each worker will receive a terminate message before <code>join</code> is called on its thread.</p> <p>To see this code in action, let’s modify <code>main</code> to accept only two requests before gracefully shutting down the server, as shown in Listing 20-25.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/bin/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">use hello::ThreadPool;

This code just demonstrates that the graceful shutdown and cleanup is in working order.</p> <p>The <code>take</code> method is defined in the <code>Iterator</code> trait and limits the iteration to the first two items at most. The <code>ThreadPool</code> will go out of scope at the end of <code>main</code>, and the <code>drop</code> implementation will run.</p> <p>Start the server with <code>cargo run</code>, and make three requests. The third request should error, and in your terminal you should see output similar to this:</p>  <pre>$ cargo run

</pre> <p>You might see a different ordering of workers and messages printed. We can see how this code works from the messages: workers 0 and 3 got the first two requests, and then on the third request, the server stopped accepting connections. When the <code>ThreadPool</code> goes out of scope at the end of <code>main</code>, its <code>Drop</code> implementation kicks in, and the pool tells all workers to terminate. The workers each print a message when they see the terminate message, and then the thread pool calls <code>join</code> to shut down each worker thread.</p> <p>Notice one interesting aspect of this particular execution: the <code>ThreadPool</code> sent the terminate messages down the channel, and before any worker received the messages, we tried to join worker 0. Worker 0 had not yet received the terminate message, so the main thread blocked waiting for worker 0 to finish. In the meantime, each of the workers received the termination messages. When worker 0 finished, the main thread waited for the rest of the workers to finish. At that point, they had all received the termination message and were able to shut down.</p> <p>Congrats! We’ve now completed our project; we have a basic web server that uses a thread pool to respond asynchronously. We’re able to perform a graceful shutdown of the server, which cleans up all the threads in the pool.</p> <p>Here’s the full code for reference:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/bin/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">use hello::ThreadPool;
