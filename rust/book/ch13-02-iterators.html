<h1 id="processing-a-series-of-items-with-iterators">Processing a Series of Items with Iterators</h1> <p>The iterator pattern allows you to perform some task on a sequence of items in turn. An iterator is responsible for the logic of iterating over each item and determining when the sequence has finished. When you use iterators, you don’t have to reimplement that logic yourself.</p> <p>In Rust, iterators are <em>lazy</em>, meaning they have no effect until you call methods that consume the iterator to use it up. For example, the code in Listing 13-13 creates an iterator over the items in the vector <code>v1</code> by calling the <code>iter</code> method defined on <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>. This code by itself doesn’t do anything useful.</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let v1_iter = v1.iter();
}
</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 13-13: Creating an iterator</span></p> <p>Once we’ve created an iterator, we can use it in a variety of ways. In Listing 3-5 in Chapter 3, we used iterators with <code>for</code> loops to execute some code on each item, although we glossed over what the call to <code>iter</code> did until now.</p> <p>The example in Listing 13-14 separates the creation of the iterator from the use of the iterator in the <code>for</code> loop. The iterator is stored in the <code>v1_iter</code> variable, and no iteration takes place at that time. When the <code>for</code> loop is called using the iterator in <code>v1_iter</code>, each element in the iterator is used in one iteration of the loop, which prints out each value.</p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {
    let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let v1_iter = v1.iter();

    for val in v1_iter {
        println!("Got: {}", val);
    }
}
</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 13-14: Using an iterator in a <code>for</code> loop</span></p> <p>In languages that don’t have iterators provided by their standard libraries, you would likely write this same functionality by starting a variable at index 0, using that variable to index into the vector to get a value, and incrementing the variable value in a loop until it reached the total number of items in the vector.</p> <p>Iterators handle all that logic for you, cutting down on repetitive code you could potentially mess up. Iterators give you more flexibility to use the same logic with many different kinds of sequences, not just data structures you can index into, like vectors. Let’s examine how iterators do that.</p> <h3 id="the-iterator-trait-and-the-next-method">The <code id="">Iterator</code> Trait and the <code>next</code> Method</h3> <p>All iterators implement a trait named <code>Iterator</code> that is defined in the standard library. The definition of the trait looks like this:</p> <pre data-language="rust">
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
pub trait Iterator {
    type Item;

    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;;

    // methods with default implementations elided
}
}
</pre> <p>Notice this definition uses some new syntax: <code>type Item</code> and <code>Self::Item</code>, which are defining an <em>associated type</em> with this trait. We’ll talk about associated types in depth in Chapter 19. For now, all you need to know is that this code says implementing the <code>Iterator</code> trait requires that you also define an <code>Item</code> type, and this <code>Item</code> type is used in the return type of the <code>next</code> method. In other words, the <code>Item</code> type will be the type returned from the iterator.</p> <p>The <code>Iterator</code> trait only requires implementors to define one method: the <code>next</code> method, which returns one item of the iterator at a time wrapped in <code>Some</code> and, when iteration is over, returns <code>None</code>.</p> <p>We can call the <code>next</code> method on iterators directly; Listing 13-15 demonstrates what values are returned from repeated calls to <code>next</code> on the iterator created from the vector.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn iterator_demonstration() {
        let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

        let mut v1_iter = v1.iter();

        assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), Some(&amp;1));
        assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), Some(&amp;2));
        assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), Some(&amp;3));
        assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), None);
    }
}
</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 13-15: Calling the <code>next</code> method on an iterator</span></p> <p>Note that we needed to make <code>v1_iter</code> mutable: calling the <code>next</code> method on an iterator changes internal state that the iterator uses to keep track of where it is in the sequence. In other words, this code <em>consumes</em>, or uses up, the iterator. Each call to <code>next</code> eats up an item from the iterator. We didn’t need to make <code>v1_iter</code> mutable when we used a <code>for</code> loop because the loop took ownership of <code>v1_iter</code> and made it mutable behind the scenes.</p> <p>Also note that the values we get from the calls to <code>next</code> are immutable references to the values in the vector. The <code>iter</code> method produces an iterator over immutable references. If we want to create an iterator that takes ownership of <code>v1</code> and returns owned values, we can call <code>into_iter</code> instead of <code>iter</code>. Similarly, if we want to iterate over mutable references, we can call <code>iter_mut</code> instead of <code>iter</code>.</p> <h3 id="methods-that-consume-the-iterator">Methods that Consume the Iterator</h3> <p>The <code>Iterator</code> trait has a number of different methods with default implementations provided by the standard library; you can find out about these methods by looking in the standard library API documentation for the <code>Iterator</code> trait. Some of these methods call the <code>next</code> method in their definition, which is why you’re required to implement the <code>next</code> method when implementing the <code>Iterator</code> trait.</p> <p>Methods that call <code>next</code> are called <em>consuming adaptors</em>, because calling them uses up the iterator. One example is the <code>sum</code> method, which takes ownership of the iterator and iterates through the items by repeatedly calling <code>next</code>, thus consuming the iterator. As it iterates through, it adds each item to a running total and returns the total when iteration is complete. Listing 13-16 has a test illustrating a use of the <code>sum</code> method:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">#[cfg(test)]

    #[test]

        let v1_iter = v1.iter();

        let total: i32 = v1_iter.sum();

        assert_eq!(total, 6);
    }
}
</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 13-16: Calling the <code>sum</code> method to get the total of all items in the iterator</span></p> <p>We aren’t allowed to use <code>v1_iter</code> after the call to <code>sum</code> because <code>sum</code> takes ownership of the iterator we call it on.</p> <h3 id="methods-that-produce-other-iterators">Methods that Produce Other Iterators</h3> <p>Other methods defined on the <code>Iterator</code> trait, known as <em>iterator adaptors</em>, allow you to change iterators into different kinds of iterators. You can chain multiple calls to iterator adaptors to perform complex actions in a readable way. But because all iterators are lazy, you have to call one of the consuming adaptor methods to get results from calls to iterator adaptors.</p> <p>Listing 13-17 shows an example of calling the iterator adaptor method <code>map</code>, which takes a closure to call on each item to produce a new iterator. The closure here creates a new iterator in which each item from the vector has been incremented by 1. However, this code produces a warning:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {

The warning reminds us why: iterator adaptors are lazy, and we need to consume the iterator here.</p> <p>To fix this and consume the iterator, we’ll use the <code>collect</code> method, which we used in Chapter 12 with <code>env::args</code> in Listing 12-1. This method consumes the iterator and collects the resulting values into a collection data type.</p> <p>In Listing 13-18, we collect the results of iterating over the iterator that’s returned from the call to <code>map</code> into a vector. This vector will end up containing each item from the original vector incremented by 1.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">fn main() {

This is a great example of how closures let you customize some behavior while reusing the iteration behavior that the <code>Iterator</code> trait provides.</p> <h3 id="using-closures-that-capture-their-environment">Using Closures that Capture Their Environment</h3> <p>Now that we’ve introduced iterators, we can demonstrate a common use of closures that capture their environment by using the <code>filter</code> iterator adaptor. The <code>filter</code> method on an iterator takes a closure that takes each item from the iterator and returns a Boolean. If the closure returns <code>true</code>, the value will be included in the iterator produced by <code>filter</code>. If the closure returns <code>false</code>, the value won’t be included in the resulting iterator.</p> <p>In Listing 13-19, we use <code>filter</code> with a closure that captures the <code>shoe_size</code> variable from its environment to iterate over a collection of <code>Shoe</code> struct instances. It will return only shoes that are the specified size.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]
