<h1 id="packages-and-crates">Packages and Crates</h1> <p>The first parts of the module system we’ll cover are packages and crates.</p> <p>A <em>package</em> is one or more crates that provide a set of functionality. A package contains a <em>Cargo.toml</em> file that describes how to build those crates.</p> <p>A <em>crate</em> can be a binary crate or a library crate. <em>Binary crates</em> are programs you can compile to an executable that you can run, such as a command-line program or a server. They must have a function called <code>main</code> that defines what happens when the executable runs. All the crates we’ve created so far have been binary crates.</p> <p><em>Library crates</em> don’t have a <code>main</code> function, and they don’t compile to an executable. They define functionality intended to be shared with multiple projects. For example, the <code>rand</code> crate we used in <a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial#generating-a-random-number">Chapter 2</a> provides functionality that generates random numbers.</p> <p>The <em>crate root</em> is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of your crate (we’ll explain modules in depth in the <a href="ch07-02-defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy">“Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy”</a> section).</p> <p>Several rules determine what a package can contain. A package can contain at most one library crate. It can contain as many binary crates as you’d like, but it must contain at least one crate (either library or binary).</p> <p>Let’s walk through what happens when we create a package. First, we enter the command <code>cargo new</code>:</p> <pre>$ cargo new my-project
     Created binary (application) `my-project` package
$ ls my-project
Cargo.toml
src
$ ls my-project/src
main.rs
</pre> <p>When we entered the command, Cargo created a <em>Cargo.toml</em> file, giving us a package. Looking at the contents of <em>Cargo.toml</em>, there’s no mention of <em>src/main.rs</em> because Cargo follows a convention that <em>src/main.rs</em> is the crate root of a binary crate with the same name as the package. Likewise, Cargo knows that if the package directory contains <em>src/lib.rs</em>, the package contains a library crate with the same name as the package, and <em>src/lib.rs</em> is its crate root. Cargo passes the crate root files to <code>rustc</code> to build the library or binary.</p> <p>Here, we have a package that only contains <em>src/main.rs</em>, meaning it only contains a binary crate named <code>my-project</code>. If a package contains <em>src/main.rs</em> and <em>src/lib.rs</em>, it has two crates: a binary and a library, both with the same name as the package. A package can have multiple binary crates by placing files in the <em>src/bin</em> directory: each file will be a separate binary crate.</p><div class="_attribution">
