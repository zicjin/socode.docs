<h1 id="the-rust-programming-language">The Rust Programming Language</h1> <p><em>by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, with contributions from the Rust Community</em></p> <p>This version of the text assumes you’re using Rust 1.55 or later with <code>edition="2018"</code> in <em>Cargo.toml</em> of all projects to use Rust 2018 Edition idioms. See the <a href="ch01-01-installation">“Installation” section of Chapter 1</a> to install or update Rust, and see the new <a href="appendix-05-editions">Appendix E</a> for information on editions.</p> <p>The 2018 Edition of the Rust language includes a number of improvements that make Rust more ergonomic and easier to learn. This iteration of the book contains a number of changes to reflect those improvements:</p> <ul> <li>Chapter 7, “Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules,” has been mostly rewritten. The module system and the way paths work in the 2018 Edition were made more consistent.</li> <li>Chapter 10 has new sections titled “Traits as Parameters” and “Returning Types that Implement Traits” that explain the new <code>impl Trait</code> syntax.</li> <li>Chapter 11 has a new section titled “Using <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> in Tests” that shows how to write tests that use the <code>?</code> operator.</li> <li>The “Advanced Lifetimes” section in Chapter 19 was removed because compiler improvements have made the constructs in that section even rarer.</li> <li>The previous Appendix D, “Macros,” has been expanded to include procedural macros and was moved to the “Macros” section in Chapter 19.</li> <li>Appendix A, “Keywords,” also explains the new raw identifiers feature that enables code written in the 2015 Edition and the 2018 Edition to interoperate.</li> <li>Appendix D is now titled “Useful Development Tools” and covers recently released tools that help you write Rust code.</li> <li>We fixed a number of small errors and imprecise wording throughout the book. Thank you to the readers who reported them!</li> </ul> <p>Note that any code in earlier iterations of <em>The Rust Programming Language</em> that compiled will continue to compile without <code>edition="2018"</code> in the project’s <em>Cargo.toml</em>, even as you update the Rust compiler version you’re using. That’s Rust’s backward compatibility guarantees at work!</p> <p>The HTML format is available online at <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/index.html">https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/</a> and offline with installations of Rust made with <code>rustup</code>; run <code>rustup docs --book</code> to open.</p> <p>This text is available in <a href="https://nostarch.com/rust">paperback and ebook format from No Starch Press</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
