<h1 id="bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword">Bringing Paths into Scope with the <code id="">use</code> Keyword</h1> <p>It might seem like the paths we’ve written to call functions so far are inconveniently long and repetitive. For example, in Listing 7-7, whether we chose the absolute or relative path to the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function, every time we wanted to call <code>add_to_waitlist</code> we had to specify <code>front_of_house</code> and <code>hosting</code> too. Fortunately, there’s a way to simplify this process. We can bring a path into a scope once and then call the items in that path as if they’re local items with the <code>use</code> keyword.</p> <p>In Listing 7-11, we bring the <code>crate::front_of_house::hosting</code> module into the scope of the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function so we only have to specify <code>hosting::add_to_waitlist</code> to call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 7-11: Bringing a module into scope with <code>use</code></span></p> <p>Adding <code>use</code> and a path in a scope is similar to creating a symbolic link in the filesystem. By adding <code>use crate::front_of_house::hosting</code> in the crate root, <code>hosting</code> is now a valid name in that scope, just as though the <code>hosting</code> module had been defined in the crate root. Paths brought into scope with <code>use</code> also check privacy, like any other paths.</p> <p>You can also bring an item into scope with <code>use</code> and a relative path. Listing 7-12 shows how to specify a relative path to get the same behavior as in Listing 7-11.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">mod front_of_house {

</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 7-13: Bringing the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function into scope with <code>use</code>, which is unidiomatic</span></p> <p>Although both Listing 7-11 and 7-13 accomplish the same task, Listing 7-11 is the idiomatic way to bring a function into scope with <code>use</code>. Bringing the function’s parent module into scope with <code>use</code> means we have to specify the parent module when calling the function. Specifying the parent module when calling the function makes it clear that the function isn’t locally defined while still minimizing repetition of the full path. The code in Listing 7-13 is unclear as to where <code>add_to_waitlist</code> is defined.</p> <p>On the other hand, when bringing in structs, enums, and other items with <code>use</code>, it’s idiomatic to specify the full path. Listing 7-14 shows the idiomatic way to bring the standard library’s <code>HashMap</code> struct into the scope of a binary crate.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">use std::collections::HashMap;

</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 7-14: Bringing <code>HashMap</code> into scope in an idiomatic way</span></p> <p>There’s no strong reason behind this idiom: it’s just the convention that has emerged, and folks have gotten used to reading and writing Rust code this way.</p> <p>The exception to this idiom is if we’re bringing two items with the same name into scope with <code>use</code> statements, because Rust doesn’t allow that. Listing 7-15 shows how to bring two <code>Result</code> types into scope that have the same name but different parent modules and how to refer to them.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">use std::fmt;
use std::io;

fn function1() -&gt; fmt::Result {

</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 7-15: Bringing two types with the same name into the same scope requires using their parent modules.</span></p> <p>As you can see, using the parent modules distinguishes the two <code>Result</code> types. If instead we specified <code>use std::fmt::Result</code> and <code>use std::io::Result</code>, we’d have two <code>Result</code> types in the same scope and Rust wouldn’t know which one we meant when we used <code>Result</code>.</p> <h3 id="providing-new-names-with-the-as-keyword">Providing New Names with the <code id="">as</code> Keyword</h3> <p>There’s another solution to the problem of bringing two types of the same name into the same scope with <code>use</code>: after the path, we can specify <code>as</code> and a new local name, or alias, for the type. Listing 7-16 shows another way to write the code in Listing 7-15 by renaming one of the two <code>Result</code> types using <code>as</code>.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">use std::fmt::Result;

    // --snip--

}
</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 7-16: Renaming a type when it’s brought into scope with the <code>as</code> keyword</span></p> <p>In the second <code>use</code> statement, we chose the new name <code>IoResult</code> for the <code>std::io::Result</code> type, which won’t conflict with the <code>Result</code> from <code>std::fmt</code> that we’ve also brought into scope. Listing 7-15 and Listing 7-16 are considered idiomatic, so the choice is up to you!</p> <h3 id="re-exporting-names-with-pub-use">Re-exporting Names with <code id="">pub use</code>
</h3> <p>When we bring a name into scope with the <code>use</code> keyword, the name available in the new scope is private. To enable the code that calls our code to refer to that name as if it had been defined in that code’s scope, we can combine <code>pub</code> and <code>use</code>. This technique is called <em>re-exporting</em> because we’re bringing an item into scope but also making that item available for others to bring into their scope.</p> <p>Listing 7-17 shows the code in Listing 7-11 with <code>use</code> in the root module changed to <code>pub use</code>.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 7-17: Making a name available for any code to use from a new scope with <code>pub use</code></span></p> <p>By using <code>pub use</code>, external code can now call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function using <code>hosting::add_to_waitlist</code>. If we hadn’t specified <code>pub use</code>, the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function could call <code>hosting::add_to_waitlist</code> in its scope, but external code couldn’t take advantage of this new path.</p> <p>Re-exporting is useful when the internal structure of your code is different from how programmers calling your code would think about the domain. For example, in this restaurant metaphor, the people running the restaurant think about “front of house” and “back of house.” But customers visiting a restaurant probably won’t think about the parts of the restaurant in those terms. With <code>pub use</code>, we can write our code with one structure but expose a different structure. Doing so makes our library well organized for programmers working on the library and programmers calling the library.</p> <h3 id="using-external-packages">Using External Packages</h3> <p>In Chapter 2, we programmed a guessing game project that used an external package called <code>rand</code> to get random numbers. To use <code>rand</code> in our project, we added this line to <em>Cargo.toml</em>:</p>  <p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p> <pre>rand = "0.8.3"
</pre> <p>Adding <code>rand</code> as a dependency in <em>Cargo.toml</em> tells Cargo to download the <code>rand</code> package and any dependencies from <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> and make <code>rand</code> available to our project.</p> <p>Then, to bring <code>rand</code> definitions into the scope of our package, we added a <code>use</code> line starting with the name of the crate, <code>rand</code>, and listed the items we wanted to bring into scope. Recall that in the <a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial#generating-a-random-number">“Generating a Random Number”</a> section in Chapter 2, we brought the <code>Rng</code> trait into scope and called the <code>rand::thread_rng</code> function:</p> <pre data-language="rust">use std::io;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..101);

    println!("The secret number is: {}", secret_number);

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);
}
</pre> <p>Members of the Rust community have made many packages available at <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, and pulling any of them into your package involves these same steps: listing them in your package’s <em>Cargo.toml</em> file and using <code>use</code> to bring items from their crates into scope.</p> <p>Note that the standard library (<code>std</code>) is also a crate that’s external to our package. Because the standard library is shipped with the Rust language, we don’t need to change <em>Cargo.toml</em> to include <code>std</code>. But we do need to refer to it with <code>use</code> to bring items from there into our package’s scope. For example, with <code>HashMap</code> we would use this line:</p> <pre data-language="rust">
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
use std::collections::HashMap;
}
</pre> <p>This is an absolute path starting with <code>std</code>, the name of the standard library crate.</p> <h3 id="using-nested-paths-to-clean-up-large-use-lists">Using Nested Paths to Clean Up Large <code id="">use</code> Lists</h3> <p>If we’re using multiple items defined in the same crate or same module, listing each item on its own line can take up a lot of vertical space in our files. For example, these two <code>use</code> statements we had in the Guessing Game in Listing 2-4 bring items from <code>std</code> into scope:</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">use rand::Rng;
// --snip--
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;
// --snip--

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..101);

    println!("The secret number is: {}", secret_number);

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);

    match guess.cmp(&amp;secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less =&gt; println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater =&gt; println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal =&gt; println!("You win!"),
    }
}
</pre> <p>Instead, we can use nested paths to bring the same items into scope in one line. We do this by specifying the common part of the path, followed by two colons, and then curly brackets around a list of the parts of the paths that differ, as shown in Listing 7-18.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">use rand::Rng;
// --snip--
use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};
// --snip--

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..101);

    println!("The secret number is: {}", secret_number);

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");

    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);

    match guess.cmp(&amp;secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less =&gt; println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater =&gt; println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal =&gt; println!("You win!"),
    }
}
</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 7-18: Specifying a nested path to bring multiple items with the same prefix into scope</span></p> <p>In bigger programs, bringing many items into scope from the same crate or module using nested paths can reduce the number of separate <code>use</code> statements needed by a lot!</p> <p>We can use a nested path at any level in a path, which is useful when combining two <code>use</code> statements that share a subpath. For example, Listing 7-19 shows two <code>use</code> statements: one that brings <code>std::io</code> into scope and one that brings <code>std::io::Write</code> into scope.</p> <p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p> <pre data-language="rust">use std::io;

</pre> <p><span class="caption">Listing 7-20: Combining the paths in Listing 7-19 into one <code>use</code> statement</span></p> <p>This line brings <code>std::io</code> and <code>std::io::Write</code> into scope.</p> <h3 id="the-glob-operator">The Glob Operator</h3> <p>If we want to bring <em>all</em> public items defined in a path into scope, we can specify that path followed by <code>*</code>, the glob operator:</p> <pre data-language="rust">
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
use std::collections::*;
}
</pre> <p>This <code>use</code> statement brings all public items defined in <code>std::collections</code> into the current scope. Be careful when using the glob operator! Glob can make it harder to tell what names are in scope and where a name used in your program was defined.</p> <p>The glob operator is often used when testing to bring everything under test into the <code>tests</code> module; we’ll talk about that in the <a href="ch11-01-writing-tests#how-to-write-tests">“How to Write Tests”</a> section in Chapter 11. The glob operator is also sometimes used as part of the prelude pattern: see <a href="../std/prelude/index#other-preludes">the standard library documentation</a> for more information on that pattern.</p><div class="_attribution">
