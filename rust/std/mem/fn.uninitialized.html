<p>Bypasses Rustâ€™s normal memory-initialization checks by pretending to produce a value of type <code>T</code>, while doing nothing at all.</p> <p><strong>This function is deprecated.</strong> Use <a href="union.maybeuninit" title="MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;"><code>MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;</code></a> instead.</p> <p>The reason for deprecation is that the function basically cannot be used correctly: it has the same effect as <a href="union.maybeuninit#method.uninit"><code>MaybeUninit::uninit().assume_init()</code></a>. As the <a href="union.maybeuninit#method.assume_init"><code>assume_init</code> documentation</a> explains, <a href="union.maybeuninit#initialization-invariant">the Rust compiler assumes</a> that values are properly initialized. As a consequence, calling e.g. <code>mem::uninitialized::&lt;bool&gt;()</code> causes immediate undefined behavior for returning a <code>bool</code> that is not definitely either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Worse, truly uninitialized memory like what gets returned here is special in that the compiler knows that it does not have a fixed value. This makes it undefined behavior to have uninitialized data in a variable even if that variable has an integer type. (Notice that the rules around uninitialized integers are not finalized yet, but until they are, it is advisable to avoid them.)</p><div class="_attribution">
