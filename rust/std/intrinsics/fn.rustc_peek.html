<p>Magic intrinsic that derives its meaning from attributes attached to the function.</p> <p>For example, dataflow uses this to inject static assertions so that <code>rustc_peek(potentially_uninitialized)</code> would actually double-check that dataflow did indeed compute that it is uninitialized at that point in the control flow.</p> <p>This intrinsic should not be used outside of the compiler.</p> </div></details><div class="_attribution">
