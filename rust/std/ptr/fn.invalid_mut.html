<span class="emoji">🔬</span> This is a nightly-only experimental API. (<code>strict_provenance</code> <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95228">#95228</a>)</div></span><p>Creates an invalid mutable pointer with the given address.</p> <p>This is <em>currently</em> equivalent to <code>addr as *mut T</code> but it expresses the intended semantic more clearly, and may become important under future memory models.</p> <p>The module’s top-level documentation discusses the precise meaning of an “invalid” pointer but essentially this expresses that the pointer is not associated with any actual allocation and is little more than a usize address in disguise.</p> <p>This pointer will have no provenance associated with it and is therefore UB to read/write/offset. This mostly exists to facilitate things like ptr::null and NonNull::dangling which make invalid pointers.</p> <p>(Standard “Zero-Sized-Types get to cheat and lie” caveats apply, although it may be desirable to give them their own API just to make that 100% clear.)</p> <p>This API and its claimed semantics are part of the Strict Provenance experiment, see the <a href="index" title="crate::ptr">module documentation</a> for details.</p><div class="_attribution">
