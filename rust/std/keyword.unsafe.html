<h1 class="fqn">Keyword unsafe</h1>
<p>Code or interfaces whose <a href="../book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust">memory safety</a> cannot be verified by the type system.</p> <p>The <code>unsafe</code> keyword has two uses: to declare the existence of contracts the compiler can’t check (<code>unsafe fn</code> and <code>unsafe trait</code>), and to declare that a programmer has checked that these contracts have been upheld (<code>unsafe {}</code> and <code>unsafe impl</code>, but also <code>unsafe fn</code> – see below). They are not mutually exclusive, as can be seen in <code>unsafe fn</code>.</p> <h3 id="unsafe-abilities" class="section-header">Unsafe abilities</h3> <p><strong>No matter what, Safe Rust can’t cause Undefined Behavior</strong>. This is referred to as <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/glossary.html#soundness-of-code--of-a-library">soundness</a>: a well-typed program actually has the desired properties. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/safe-unsafe-meaning.html">Nomicon</a> has a more detailed explanation on the subject.</p> <p>To ensure soundness, Safe Rust is restricted enough that it can be automatically checked. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to write code that is correct for reasons which are too clever for the compiler to understand. In those cases, you need to use Unsafe Rust.</p> <p>Here are the abilities Unsafe Rust has in addition to Safe Rust:</p> <ul> <li>Dereference <a href="../reference/types/pointer">raw pointers</a>
</li> <li>Implement <code>unsafe</code> <a href="keyword.trait"><code>trait</code></a>s</li> <li>Call <code>unsafe</code> functions</li> <li>Mutate <a href="keyword.static"><code>static</code></a>s (including <a href="keyword.extern"><code>extern</code></a>al ones)</li> <li>Access fields of <a href="keyword.union"><code>union</code></a>s</li> </ul> <p>However, this extra power comes with extra responsibilities: it is now up to you to ensure soundness. The <code>unsafe</code> keyword helps by clearly marking the pieces of code that need to worry about this.</p> <h3 id="the-different-meanings-of-unsafe" class="section-header">The different meanings of <code>unsafe</code>
</h3> <p>Not all uses of <code>unsafe</code> are equivalent: some are here to mark the existence of a contract the programmer must check, others are to say “I have checked the contract, go ahead and do this”. The following <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/what-does-unsafe-mean/6696">discussion on Rust Internals</a> has more in-depth explanations about this but here is a summary of the main points:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>unsafe fn</code>: calling this function means abiding by a contract the compiler cannot enforce.</li> <li>
<code>unsafe trait</code>: implementing the <a href="keyword.trait"><code>trait</code></a> means abiding by a contract the compiler cannot enforce.</li> <li>
<code>unsafe {}</code>: the contract necessary to call the operations inside the block has been checked by the programmer and is guaranteed to be respected.</li> <li>
<code>unsafe impl</code>: the contract necessary to implement the trait has been checked by the programmer and is guaranteed to be respected.</li> </ul> <p><code>unsafe fn</code> also acts like an <code>unsafe {}</code> block around the code inside the function. This means it is not just a signal to the caller, but also promises that the preconditions for the operations inside the function are upheld. Mixing these two meanings can be confusing and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2585">proposal</a>s exist to use <code>unsafe {}</code> blocks inside such functions when making <code>unsafe</code> operations.</p> <p>See the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/index.html">Rustnomicon</a> and the <a href="../reference/unsafety">Reference</a> for more informations.</p> <h3 id="examples" class="section-header">Examples</h3>
<h3 id="marking-elements-as-unsafe" class="section-header">Marking elements as <code>unsafe</code>
</h3> <p><code>unsafe</code> can be used on functions. Note that functions and statics declared in <a href="keyword.extern"><code>extern</code></a> blocks are implicitly marked as <code>unsafe</code> (but not functions declared as <code>extern "something" fn ...</code>). Mutable statics are always unsafe, wherever they are declared. Methods can also be declared as <code>unsafe</code>:</p> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">static mut FOO: &amp;str = "hello";

unsafe fn unsafe_fn() {}

extern "C" {
    fn unsafe_extern_fn();
    static BAR: *mut u32;
}

trait SafeTraitWithUnsafeMethod {
    unsafe fn unsafe_method(&amp;self);
}

struct S;

impl S {
    unsafe fn unsafe_method_on_struct() {}
}</pre></div> <p>Traits can also be declared as <code>unsafe</code>:</p> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">unsafe trait UnsafeTrait {}</pre></div> <p>Since <code>unsafe fn</code> and <code>unsafe trait</code> indicate that there is a safety contract that the compiler cannot enforce, documenting it is important. The standard library has many examples of this, like the following which is an extract from <a href="vec/struct.vec#method.set_len" title="Vec::set_len"><code>Vec::set_len</code></a>. The <code># Safety</code> section explains the contract that must be fulfilled to safely call the function.</p> <div class="information">ⓘ This example is not tested</div>
<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered ignore" data-language="rust">/// Forces the length of the vector to `new_len`.
///
/// This is a low-level operation that maintains none of the normal

The <a href="marker/trait.send" title="Send">Send</a> and <a href="marker/trait.sync" title="Sync">Sync</a> traits are examples of this behaviour in the standard library.</p> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">/// Implementors of this trait must guarantee an element is always
