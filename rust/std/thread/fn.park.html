<p>Blocks unless or until the current thread’s token is made available.</p> <p>A call to <code>park</code> does not guarantee that the thread will remain parked forever, and callers should be prepared for this possibility.</p> <h2 id="park-and-unpark" class="section-header">park and unpark</h2> <p>Every thread is equipped with some basic low-level blocking support, via the <a href="fn.park" title="park"><code>thread::park</code></a> function and <a href="struct.thread#method.unpark"><code>thread::Thread::unpark</code></a> method. <a href="fn.park" title="park"><code>park</code></a> blocks the current thread, which can then be resumed from another thread by calling the <a href="struct.thread#method.unpark"><code>unpark</code></a> method on the blocked thread’s handle.</p> <p>Conceptually, each <a href="struct.thread" title="Thread"><code>Thread</code></a> handle has an associated token, which is initially not present:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The <a href="fn.park" title="park"><code>thread::park</code></a> function blocks the current thread unless or until the token is available for its thread handle, at which point it atomically consumes the token. It may also return <em>spuriously</em>, without consuming the token. <a href="fn.park_timeout"><code>thread::park_timeout</code></a> does the same, but allows specifying a maximum time to block the thread for.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <a href="struct.thread#method.unpark"><code>unpark</code></a> method on a <a href="struct.thread" title="Thread"><code>Thread</code></a> atomically makes the token available if it wasn’t already. Because the token is initially absent, <a href="struct.thread#method.unpark"><code>unpark</code></a> followed by <a href="fn.park" title="park"><code>park</code></a> will result in the second call returning immediately.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In other words, each <a href="struct.thread" title="Thread"><code>Thread</code></a> acts a bit like a spinlock that can be locked and unlocked using <code>park</code> and <code>unpark</code>.</p> <p>Notice that being unblocked does not imply any synchronization with someone that unparked this thread, it could also be spurious. For example, it would be a valid, but inefficient, implementation to make both <a href="fn.park" title="park"><code>park</code></a> and <a href="struct.thread#method.unpark"><code>unpark</code></a> return immediately without doing anything.</p> <p>The API is typically used by acquiring a handle to the current thread, placing that handle in a shared data structure so that other threads can find it, and then <code>park</code>ing in a loop. When some desired condition is met, another thread calls <a href="struct.thread#method.unpark"><code>unpark</code></a> on the handle.</p> <p>The motivation for this design is twofold:</p> <ul> <li> <p>It avoids the need to allocate mutexes and condvars when building new synchronization primitives; the threads already provide basic blocking/signaling.</p> </li> <li> <p>It can be implemented very efficiently on many platforms.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="examples" class="section-header">Examples</h2> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">
