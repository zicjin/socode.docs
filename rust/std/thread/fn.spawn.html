<p>Spawns a new thread, returning a <a href="struct.joinhandle" title="JoinHandle"><code>JoinHandle</code></a> for it.</p> <p>The join handle will implicitly <em>detach</em> the child thread upon being dropped. In this case, the child thread may outlive the parent (unless the parent thread is the main thread; the whole process is terminated when the main thread finishes). Additionally, the join handle provides a <a href="struct.joinhandle#method.join"><code>join</code></a> method that can be used to join the child thread. If the child thread panics, <a href="struct.joinhandle#method.join"><code>join</code></a> will return an <a href="../result/enum.result#variant.Err"><code>Err</code></a> containing the argument given to <a href="../macro.panic" title="panic!"><code>panic!</code></a>.</p> <p>This will create a thread using default parameters of <a href="struct.builder" title="Builder"><code>Builder</code></a>, if you want to specify the stack size or the name of the thread, use this API instead.</p> <p>As you can see in the signature of <code>spawn</code> there are two constraints on both the closure given to <code>spawn</code> and its return value, let’s explain them:</p> <ul> <li>The <code>'static</code> constraint means that the closure and its return value must have a lifetime of the whole program execution. The reason for this is that threads can <code>detach</code> and outlive the lifetime they have been created in. Indeed if the thread, and by extension its return value, can outlive their caller, we need to make sure that they will be valid afterwards, and since we <em>can’t</em> know when it will return we need to have them valid as long as possible, that is until the end of the program, hence the <code>'static</code> lifetime.</li> <li>The <a href="../marker/trait.send" title="Send"><code>Send</code></a> constraint is because the closure will need to be passed <em>by value</em> from the thread where it is spawned to the new thread. Its return value will need to be passed from the new thread to the thread where it is <code>join</code>ed. As a reminder, the <a href="../marker/trait.send" title="Send"><code>Send</code></a> marker trait expresses that it is safe to be passed from thread to thread. <a href="../marker/trait.sync" title="Sync"><code>Sync</code></a> expresses that it is safe to have a reference be passed from thread to thread.</li> </ul> <h2 id="panics" class="section-header">Panics</h2> <p>Panics if the OS fails to create a thread; use <a href="struct.builder#method.spawn" title="Builder::spawn"><code>Builder::spawn</code></a> to recover from such errors.</p> <h2 id="examples" class="section-header">Examples</h2> <p>Creating a thread.</p> <div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered" data-language="rust">
use std::thread;

let handler = thread::spawn(|| {
    // thread code
