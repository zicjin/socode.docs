     <h1 id="document_title">SQLite File IO Specification</h1>    <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1> <p> SQLite stores an entire database within a single file, the format of which is described in the <i>SQLite File Database File Format</i> document <cite>ff_sqlitert_requirements</cite>. Each database file is stored within a file system, presumably provided by the host operating system. Instead of interfacing with the operating system directly, the host application is required to supply an adaptor component that implements the <i>SQLite Virtual File System</i> interface (described in <cite>capi_sqlitert_requirements</cite>). The adaptor component is responsible for translating the calls made by SQLite to the <i>VFS</i> interface into calls to the file-system interface provided by the operating system. This arrangement is depicted in figure <cite>figure_vfs_role</cite>. </p>

<p><i>Figure <span class="fig" id="figure_vfs_role"></span> - Virtual File System (VFS) Adaptor</i> </p>
</center> <p> Although it would be easy to design a system that uses the <i>VFS</i> interface to read and update the content of a database file stored within a file-system, there are several complicated issues that need to be addressed by such a system: </p>
<ol> <li>
<p>SQLite is required to <b>implement atomic and durable transactions</b> (the 'A' and 'D' from the ACID acronym), even if an application, operating system or power failure occurs midway through or shortly after updating a database file. </p>
<p>To implement atomic transactions in the face of potential application, operating system or power failures, database writers write a copy of those portions of the database file that they are going to modify into a second file, the <i>journal file</i>, before writing to the database file. If a failure does occur while modifying the database file, SQLite can reconstruct the original database (before the modifications were attempted) based on the contents of the <i>journal file</i>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SQLite is required to <b>implement isolated transactions</b> (the 'I' from the ACID acronym). </p>
<p>This is done by using the file locking facilities provided by the VFS adaptor to serialize writers (write transactions) and preventing readers (read transactions) from accessing database files while writers are midway through updating them. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For performance reasons, it is advantageous to <b>minimize the quantity of data read and written</b> to and from the file-system. </p>
<p>As one might expect, the amount of data read from the database file is minimized by caching portions of the database file in main memory. Additionally, multiple updates to the database file that are part of the same <i>write transaction</i> may be cached in main memory and written to the file together, allowing for more efficient IO patterns and eliminating the redundant write operations that could take place if part of the database file is modified more than once within a single <i>write transaction</i>. </p>
</li>
</ol> <p class="todo">TODO:  System requirement references for the above points. </p>
<p> This document describes in detail the way that SQLite uses the API provided by the VFS adaptor component to solve the problems and implement the strategies enumerated above. It also specifies the assumptions made about the properties of the system that the VFS adaptor provides access to. For example, specific assumptions about the extent of data corruption that may occur if a power failure occurs while a database file is being updated are presented in section <cite>fs_characteristics</cite>. </p>
<p> This document does not specify the details of the interface that must be implemented by the VFS adaptor component, that is left to <cite>capi_sqlitert_requirements</cite>. </p>

</ol> <h2>Document Structure</h2> <p> Section <cite>vfs_assumptions</cite> of this document describes the various assumptions made about the system to which the VFS adaptor component provides access. The basic capabilities and functions required from the VFS implementation are presented along with the description of the VFS interface in <cite>capi_sqlitert_requirements</cite>. Section <cite>vfs_assumptions</cite> complements this by describing in more detail the assumptions made about VFS implementations on which the algorithms presented in this document depend. Some of these assumptions relate to performance issues, but most concern the expected state of the file-system following a failure that occurs midway through modifying a database file. </p>
<p> Section <cite>database_connections</cite> introduces the concept of a <i>database connection</i>, a combination of a file-handle and in-memory cache used to access a database file. It also describes the VFS operations required when a new <i>database connection</i> is created (opened), and when one is destroyed (closed). </p>
<p> Section <cite>reading_data</cite> describes the steps required to open a <i>read transaction</i> and read data from a database file. </p>
<p> Section <cite>writing_data</cite> describes the steps required to open a <i>write transaction </i> and write data to a database file. </p>
<p> Section <cite>rollback</cite> describes the way in which aborted <i>write transactions</i> may be rolled back (reverted), either as a result of an explicit user directive or because an application, operating system or power failure occurred while SQLite was midway through updating a database file. </p>
<p> Section <cite>page_cache_algorithms</cite> describes some of the algorithms used to determine exactly which portions of the database file are cached by a <i>page cache</i>, and the effect that they have on the quantity and nature of the required VFS operations. It may at first seem odd to include the <i>page cache</i>, which is primarily an implementation detail, in this document. However, it is necessary to acknowledge and describe the <i>page cache</i> in order to provide a more complete explanation of the nature and quantity of IO performed by SQLite. </p>
<h2>Glossary</h2> <p class="todo">TODO:  After this document is ready, make the vocabulary consistent and then add a glossary here. </p>
<h1 id="vfs_assumptions">VFS Adaptor Related Assumptions</h1> <p> This section documents those assumptions made about the system that the VFS adaptor provides access to. The assumptions noted in section <cite>fs_characteristics</cite> are particularly important. If these assumptions are not true, then a power or operating system failure may cause SQLite databases to become corrupted. </p>
<h2 id="fs_performance">Performance Related Assumptions</h2> <p> SQLite uses the assumptions in this section to try to speed up reading from and writing to the database file. </p>
<p class="req" id="A21010"> It is assumed that writing a series of sequential blocks of data to a file in order is faster than writing the same blocks in an arbitrary order. </p> <h2 id="fs_characteristics">System Failure Related Assumptions</h2> <p> In the event of an operating system or power failure, the various combinations of file-system software and storage hardware available provide varying levels of guarantee as to the integrity of the data written to the file system just before or during the failure. The exact combination of IO operations that SQLite is required to perform in order to safely modify a database file depend on the exact characteristics of the target platform. </p>
<p> This section describes the assumptions that SQLite makes about the content of a file-system following a power or system failure. In other words, it describes the extent of file and file-system corruption that such an event may cause. </p>
<p> SQLite queries an implementation for file-system characteristics using the xDeviceCharacteristics() and xSectorSize() methods of the database file file-handle. These two methods are only ever called on file-handles open on database files. They are not called for <i>journal files</i>, <i>master-journal files</i> or <i>temporary database files</i>. </p>
<p> The file-system <i>sector size</i> value determined by calling the xSectorSize() method is a power of 2 value between 512 and 32768, inclusive <span class="todo">TODO: reference to exactly how this is determined</span>. SQLite assumes that the underlying storage device stores data in blocks of <i>sector-size</i> bytes each, sectors. It is also assumed that each aligned block of <i>sector-size</i> bytes of each file is stored in a single device sector. If the file is not an exact multiple of <i>sector-size</i> bytes in size, then the final device sector is partially empty. </p>
<p> Normally, SQLite assumes that if a power failure occurs while updating any portion of a sector then the contents of the entire device sector is suspect following recovery. After writing to any part of a sector within a file, it is assumed that the modified sector contents are held in a volatile buffer somewhere within the system (main memory, disk cache etc.). SQLite does not assume that the updated data has reached the persistent storage media, until after it has successfully <i>synced</i> the corresponding file by invoking the VFS xSync() method. <i>Syncing</i> a file causes all modifications to the file up until that point to be committed to persistent storage. </p>
<p> Based on the above, SQLite is designed around a model of the file-system whereby any sector of a file written to is considered to be in a transient state until after the file has been successfully <i>synced</i>. Should a power or system failure occur while a sector is in a transient state, it is impossible to predict its contents following recovery. It may be written correctly, not written at all, overwritten with random data, or any combination thereof. </p>
<p> For example, if the <i>sector-size</i> of a given file-system is 2048 bytes, and SQLite opens a file and writes a 1024 byte block of data to offset 3072 of the file, then according to the model the second sector of the file is in the transient state. If a power failure or operating system crash occurs before or during the next call to xSync() on the file handle, then following system recovery SQLite assumes that all file data between byte offsets 2048 and 4095, inclusive, is invalid. It also assumes that since the first sector of the file, containing the data from byte offset 0 to 2047 inclusive, is valid, since it was not in a transient state when the crash occurred. </p>
<p> Assuming that any and all sectors in the transient state may be corrupted following a power or system failure is a very pessimistic approach. Some modern systems provide more sophisticated guarantees than this. SQLite allows the VFS implementation to specify at runtime that the current platform supports zero or more of the following properties: </p>
<ul> <li><p>The <b>safe-append</b> property. If a system supports the <i>safe-append</i> property, it means that when a file is extended the new data is written to the persistent media before the size of the file itself is updated. This guarantees that if a failure occurs after a file has been extended, following recovery the write operations that extended the file will appear to have succeeded or not occurred at all. It is not possible for invalid or garbage data to appear in the extended region of the file. </p></li>
<li><p>The <b>atomic-write</b> property. A system that supports this property also specifies the size or sizes of the blocks that it is capable of writing. Valid sizes are powers of two greater than 512. If a write operation modifies a block of <i>n</i> bytes, where <i>n</i> is one of the block sizes for which <i>atomic-write</i> is supported, then it is impossible for an aligned write of <i>n</i> bytes to cause data corruption. If a failure occurs after such a write operation and before the applicable file handle is <i>synced</i>, then following recovery it will appear as if the write operation succeeded or did not take place at all. It is not possible that only part of the data specified by the write operation was written to persistent media, nor is it possible for any content of the sectors spanned by the write operation to be replaced with garbage data, as it is normally assumed to be. </p></li>
<li>
<p>The <b>sequential-write</b> property. A system that supports the <i>sequential-write</i> property guarantees that the various write operations on files within the same file-system are written to the persistent media in the same order that they are performed by the application and that each operation is concluded before the next is begun. If a system supports the <i>sequential-write</i> property, then the model used to determine the possible states of the file-system following a failure is different. </p>
<p>If a system supports <i>sequential-write</i> it is assumed that <i>syncing</i> any file within the file system flushes all write operations on all files (not just the <i>synced</i> file) to the persistent media. If a failure does occur, it is not known whether or not any of the write operations performed by SQLite since the last time a file was <i>synced</i>. SQLite is able to assume that if the write operations of unknown status are arranged in the order that they occurred: </p>
<ol> <li> the first <i>n</i> operations will have been executed successfully, </li>
<li> the next operation puts all device sectors that it modifies into the transient state, so that following recovery each sector may be partially written, completely written, not written at all or populated with garbage data, </li>
<li> the remaining operations will not have had any effect on the contents of the file-system. </li>
</ol> </li>
</ul> <h3 id="fs_assumption_details">Failure Related Assumption Details</h3> <p> This section describes how the assumptions presented in the parent section apply to the individual API functions and operations provided by the VFS to SQLite for the purposes of modifying the contents of the file-system. </p>
<p> SQLite manipulates the contents of the file-system using a combination of the following four types of operation: </p>
<ul> <li> <b>Create file</b> operations. SQLite may create new files within the file-system by invoking the xOpen() method of the sqlite3_io_methods object. </li>
<li> <b>Delete file</b> operations. SQLite may remove files from the file system by calling the xDelete() method of the sqlite3_io_methods object. </li>
<li> <b>Truncate file</b> operations. SQLite may truncate existing files by invoking the xTruncate() method of the sqlite3_file object. </li>
<li> <b>Write file</b> operations. SQLite may modify the contents and increase the size of a file by files by invoking the xWrite() method of the sqlite3_file object. </li>
</ul> <p> Additionally, all VFS implementations are required to provide the <i>sync file</i> operation, accessed via the xSync() method of the sqlite3_file object, used to flush create, write and truncate operations on a file to the persistent storage medium. </p>
<p> The formalized assumptions in this section refer to <i>system failure</i> events. In this context, this should be interpreted as any failure that causes the system to stop operating. For example a power failure or operating system crash. </p>
<p> SQLite does not assume that a <b>create file</b> operation has actually modified the file-system records within persistent storage until after the file has been successfully <i>synced</i>. </p>
<p class="req" id="A21001"> If a system failure occurs during or after a "create file" operation, but before the created file has been <i>synced</i>, then SQLite assumes that it is possible that the created file may not exist following system recovery. </p> <p> Of course, it is also possible that it does exist following system recovery. </p>
<p class="req" id="A21002"> If a "create file" operation is executed by SQLite, and then the created file <i>synced</i>, then SQLite assumes that the file-system modifications corresponding to the "create file" operation have been committed to persistent media. It is assumed that if a system failure occurs any time after the file has been successfully <i>synced</i>, then the file is guaranteed to appear in the file-system following system recovery. </p> <p> A <b>delete file</b> operation (invoked by a call to the VFS xDelete() method) is assumed to be an atomic and durable operation. </p> <p class="req" id="A21003"> If a system failure occurs at any time after a "delete file" operation (call to the VFS xDelete() method) returns successfully, it is assumed that the file-system will not contain the deleted file following system recovery. </p>
<p class="req" id="A21004"> If a system failure occurs during a "delete file" operation, it is assumed that following system recovery the file-system will either contain the file being deleted in the state it was in before the operation was attempted, or not contain the file at all. It is assumed that it is not possible for the file to have become corrupted purely as a result of a failure occurring during a "delete file" operation. </p> <p> The effects of a <b>truncate file</b> operation are not assumed to be made persistent until after the corresponding file has been <i>synced</i>. </p>
<p class="req" id="A21005"> If a system failure occurs during or after a "truncate file" operation, but before the truncated file has been <i>synced</i>, then SQLite assumes that the size of the truncated file is either as large or larger than the size that it was to be truncated to. </p>
<p class="req" id="A21006"> If a system failure occurs during or after a "truncate file" operation, but before the truncated file has been <i>synced</i>, then it is assumed that the contents of the file up to the size that the file was to be truncated to are not corrupted. </p> <p> The above two assumptions may be interpreted to mean that if a system failure occurs after file truncation but before the truncated file is <i>synced</i>, the contents of the file following the point at which it was to be truncated may not be trusted. They may contain the original file data, or may contain garbage. </p>
<p class="req" id="A21007"> If a "truncate file" operation is executed by SQLite, and then the truncated file <i>synced</i>, then SQLite assumes that the file-system modifications corresponding to the "truncate file" operation have been committed to persistent media. It is assumed that if a system failure occurs any time after the file has been successfully <i>synced</i>, then the effects of the file truncation are guaranteed to appear in the file system following recovery. </p> <p> A <b>write file</b> operation modifies the contents of an existing file within the file-system. It may also increase the size of the file. The effects of a <i>write file</i> operation are not assumed to be made persistent until after the corresponding file has been <i>synced</i>. </p>
<p class="req" id="A21008"> If a system failure occurs during or after a "write file" operation, but before the corresponding file has been <i>synced</i>, then it is assumed that the content of all sectors spanned by the <i>write file</i> operation are untrustworthy following system recovery. This includes regions of the sectors that were not actually modified by the write file operation. </p>
<p class="req" id="A21011"> If a system failure occurs on a system that supports the <i>atomic-write</i> property for blocks of size <i>N</i> bytes following an aligned write of <i>N</i> bytes to a file but before the file has been successfully <i>synced</i>, then is assumed following recovery that all sectors spanned by the write operation were correctly updated, or that none of the sectors were modified at all. </p>
<p class="req" id="A21012"> If a system failure occurs on a system that supports the <i>safe-append</i> following a write operation that appends data to the end of the file without modifying any of the existing file content but before the file has been successfully <i>synced</i>, then is assumed following recovery that either the data was correctly appended to the file, or that the file size remains unchanged. It is assumed that it is impossible that the file be extended but populated with incorrect data. </p>
<p class="req" id="A21013"> Following a system recovery, if a device sector is deemed to be untrustworthy as defined by A21008 and neither A21011 or A21012 apply to the range of bytes written, then no assumption can be made about the content of the sector following recovery. It is assumed that it is possible for such a sector to be written correctly, not written at all, populated with garbage data or any combination thereof. </p>
<p class="req" id="A21009"> If a system failure occurs during or after a "write file" operation that causes the file to grow, but before the corresponding file has been <i>synced</i>, then it is assumed that the size of the file following recovery is as large or larger than it was when it was most recently <i>synced</i>. </p> <p> If a system supports the <i>sequential-write</i> property, then further assumptions may be made with respect to the state of the file-system following recovery from a <i>system failure</i>. Specifically, it is assumed that create, truncate, delete and write file operations are applied to the persistent representation in the same order as they are performed by SQLite. Furthermore, it is assumed that the file-system waits until one operation is safely written to the persistent media before the next is attempted, just as if the relevant file were <i>synced</i> following each operation. </p>
<p class="req" id="A21014"> If a system failure occurs on a system that supports the <i>sequential-write</i> property, then it is assumed that all operations completed before the last time any file was <i>synced</i> have been successfully committed to persistent media. </p>
<p class="req" id="A21015"> If a system failure occurs on a system that supports the <i>sequential-write</i> property, then it is assumed that the set of possible states that the file-system may be in following recovery is the same as if each of the write operations performed since the most recent time a file was <i>synced</i> was itself followed by a <i>sync file</i> operation, and that the system failure may have occurred during any of the write or <i>sync file</i> operations. </p> <h1 id="database_connections">Database Connections</h1> <p> Within this document, the term <i>database connection</i> has a slightly different meaning from that which one might assume. The handles returned by the <code>sqlite3_open()</code> and <code>sqlite3_open16()</code> APIs (<span class="todo">TODO: reference</span>) are referred to as <i>database handles</i>. A <i>database connection</i> is a connection to a single database file using a single file-handle, which is held open for the lifetime of the connection. Using the SQL ATTACH syntax, multiple <i>database connections</i> may be accessed via a single <i>database handle</i>. Or, using SQLite's <i>shared-cache mode</i> feature, multiple <i>database handles</i> may access a single <i>database connection</i>. </p>
<p> Usually, a new <i>database connection</i> is opened whenever the user opens new <i>database handle</i> on a real database file (not an in-memory database) or when a database file is attached to an existing <i>database connection</i> using the SQL ATTACH syntax. However if the <i>shared-cache mode</i> feature is enabled, then the database file may be accessed through an existing <i>database connection</i>. For more information on <i>shared-cache mode</i>, refer to <span class="todo">TODO: Reference</span>. The various IO operations required to open a new connection are detailed in section <cite>open_new_connection</cite> of this document. </p>
<p> Similarly, a <i>database connection</i> is usually closed when the user closes a <i>database handle</i> that is open on a real database file or has had one or more real database files attached to it using the ATTACH mechanism, or when a real database file is detached from a <i>database connection</i> using the DETACH syntax. Again, the exception is if <i>shared-cache mode</i> is enabled. In this case, a <i>database connection</i> is not closed until its number of users reaches zero. The IO related steps required to close a <i>database connection</i> are described in section <cite>closing_database_connection</cite>. </p>
<p class="todo">TODO:  After sections 4 and 5 are finished, come back here and see if we can add a list of state items associated with each database connection to make things easier to understand. i.e each database connection has a file handle, a set of entries in the page cache, an expected page size etc. </p>
<h2 id="open_new_connection">Opening a New Connection</h2> <p> This section describes the VFS operations that take place when a new database connection is created. </p>
<p> Opening a new database connection is a two-step process: </p>
<ol> <li> A file-handle is opened on the database file. </li>
<li> If step 1 was successful, an attempt is made to read the <i>database file header</i> from the database file using the new file-handle. </li>
</ol> <p> In step 2 of the procedure above, the database file is not locked before it is read from. This is the only exception to the locking rules described in section <cite>reading_data</cite>. </p>
<p> The reason for attempting to read the <i>database file header</i> is to determine the <i>page-size</i> used by the database file. Because it is not possible to be certain as to the <i>page-size</i> without holding at least a <i>shared lock</i> on the database file (because some other <i>database connection</i> might have changed it since the <i>database file header</i> was read), the value read from the <i>database file header</i> is known as the <i>expected page size</i>. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35060"> When a new <i>database connection</i> is required, SQLite shall attempt to open a file-handle on the database file. If the attempt fails, then no new <i>database connection</i> is created and an error returned. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35070"> When a new <i>database connection</i> is required, after opening the new file-handle, SQLite shall attempt to read the first 100 bytes of the database file. If the attempt fails for any other reason than that the opened file is less than 100 bytes in size, then the file-handle is closed, no new <i>database connection</i> is created and an error returned instead. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35080"> If the <i>database file header</i> is successfully read from a newly opened database file, the connections <i>expected page-size</i> shall be set to the value stored in the <i>page-size field</i> of the database header. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35090"> If the <i>database file header</i> cannot be read from a newly opened database file (because the file is less than 100 bytes in size), the connections <i>expected page-size</i> shall be set to the compile time value of the SQLITE_DEFAULT_PAGESIZE option. </p>
<h2 id="closing_database_connection">Closing a Connection</h2> <p> This section describes the VFS operations that take place when an existing database connection is closed (destroyed). </p>
<p> Closing a database connection is a simple matter. The open VFS file-handle is closed and in-memory <i>page cache</i> related resources are released. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35400"> When a <i>database connection</i> is closed, SQLite shall close the associated file handle at the VFS level. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35430"> When a <i>database connection</i> is closed, all associated <i>page cache</i> entries shall be discarded. </p>
<h1 id="page_cache">The Page Cache</h1> <p> The contents of an SQLite database file are formatted as a set of fixed size pages. See <cite>ff_sqlitert_requirements</cite> for a complete description of the format used. The <i>page size</i> used for a particular database is stored as part of the database file header at a well-known offset within the first 100 bytes of the file. Almost all read and write operations performed by SQLite on database files are done on blocks of data <i>page-size</i> bytes in size. </p>
<p> All SQLite database connections running within a single process share a single <i>page cache</i>. The <i>page cache</i> caches data read from database files in main-memory on a per-page basis. When SQLite requires data from a database file to satisfy a database query, it checks the <i> page cache</i> for usable cached versions of the required database pages before loading it from the database file. If no usable cache entry can be found and the database page data is loaded from the database file, it is cached in the <i>page cache</i> in case the same data is needed again later. Because reading from the database file is assumed to be an order of magnitude slower than reading from main-memory, caching database page content in the <i>page cache</i> to minimize the number of read operations performed on the database file is a significant performance enhancement. </p>
<p> The <i>page cache</i> is also used to buffer database write operations. When SQLite is required to modify one of more of the <i>database pages</i> that make up a database file, it first modifies the cached version of the page in the <i>page cache</i>. At that point the page is considered a "dirty" page. At some point later on, the new content of the "dirty" page is copied from the <i>page cache</i> into the database file via the VFS interface. Buffering writes in the <i>page cache</i> can reduce the number of write operations required on the database file (in cases where the same page is updated twice) and allows optimizations based on the assumptions outlined in section <cite>fs_performance</cite>. </p>
<p> Database read and write operations, and the way in which they interact with and use the <i>page cache</i>, are described in detail in sections <cite>reading_data</cite> and <cite>writing_data</cite> of this document, respectively. </p>
<p> At any one time, the <i>page cache</i> contains zero or more <i>page cache entries</i>, each of which has the following data associated with it: </p>
<ul> <li><p> A reference to <b>the associated <i>database connection</i></b>. Each entry in the <i>page cache</i> is associated with a single <i>database connection</i>; the <i>database connection</i> that created the entry. A <i>page cache entry</i> is only ever used by the <i>database connection</i> that created it. Page cache entries are not shared between <i>database connections</i>. </p></li>
<li><p> The <b><i>page number</i></b> of the cached page. Pages are sequentially numbered within a database file starting from page 1 (page 1 begins at byte offset 0). Refer to <cite>ff_sqlitert_requirements</cite> for details. </p></li>
<li><p> The <b>cached data</b>; a blob of data <i>page-size</i> bytes in size. </p></li>
</ul> <p> The first two elements in the list above, the associated <i>database connection</i> and the <i>page number</i>, uniquely identify the <i>page cache entry</i>. At no time may the <i>page cache</i> contain two entries for which both the <i>database connection</i> and <i>page number</i> are identical. Or, put another way, a single <i>database connection</i> never caches more than one copy of a database page within the <i>page cache</i>. </p>
<p> At any one time, each <i>page cache entry</i> may be said to be a <i>clean page</i>, a <i>non-writable dirty page</i> or a <i>writable dirty page</i>, according to the following definitions: </p>
<ul> <li> <p>A <b><i>clean page</i></b> is one for which the cached data currently matches the contents of the corresponding page of the database file. The page has not been modified since it was loaded from the file. </p>
</li>
<li> <p>A <b><i>dirty page</i></b> is a <i>page cache entry</i> for which the cached data has been modified since it was loaded from the database file, and so no longer matches the current contents of the corresponding database file page. A <i>dirty page</i> is one that is currently buffering a modification made to the database file as part of a <i>write transaction</i>. </p>
</li>
<li> <p>Within this document, the term <b><i>non-writable dirty page</i></b> is used specifically to refer to a <i>page cache entry</i> with modified content for which it is not yet safe to update the database file with. It is not safe to update a database file with a buffered write if a power or system failure that occurs during or soon after the update may cause the database to become corrupt following system recovery, according to the assumptions made in section <cite>fs_assumption_details</cite>. </p>
</li>
<li> <p>A <i>dirty page</i> for which it would be safe to update the corresponding database file page with the modified contents of without risking database corruption is known as a <b><i>writable dirty page</i></b>. </p>
</li>
</ul> <p> The exact logic used to determine if a <i>page cache entry</i> with modified content is a <i>dirty page</i> or <i>writable page</i> is presented in section <cite>page_cache_algorithms</cite>. </p>
<p> Because main-memory is a limited resource, the <i>page cache</i> cannot be allowed to grow indefinitely. As a result, unless all database files opened by database connections within the process are quite small, sometimes data must be discarded from the <i>page cache</i>. In practice this means <i>page cache entries</i> must be purged to make room for new ones. If a <i>page cache entry</i> being removed from the <i>page cache</i> to free main-memory is a <i>dirty page</i>, then its contents must be saved into the database file before it can be discarded without data loss. The following two sub-sections describe the algorithms used by the <i>page cache</i> to determine exactly when existing <i>page cache entries</i> are purged (discarded). </p>
<h2>Page Cache Configuration</h2> <p class="todo">TODO:  Describe the parameters set to configure the page cache limits. </p>
<h2 id="page_cache_algorithms">Page Cache Algorithms</h2> <p class="todo">TODO:  Requirements describing the way in which the configuration parameters are used. About LRU etc. </p>
<h1 id="reading_data">Reading Data</h1> <p> In order to return data from the database to the user, for example as the results of a SELECT query, SQLite must at some point read data from the database file. Usually, data is read from the database file in aligned blocks of <i>page-size</i> bytes. The exception is when the database file header fields are being inspected, before the <i>page-size</i> used by the database can be known. </p>
<p> With two exceptions, a <i>database connection</i> must have an open transaction (either a <i>read-only transaction</i> or a <i>read/write transaction</i>) on the database before data may be read from the database file. </p>
<p> The two exceptions are: </p>
<ul> <li> When an attempt is made to read the 100 byte <i>database file header</i> immediately after opening the <i>database connection</i> (see section <cite>open_new_connection</cite>). When this occurs no lock is held on the database file. </li>
<li> Data read while in the process of opening a read-only transaction (see section <cite>open_read_only_trans</cite>). These read operations occur after a <i>shared lock</i> is held on the database file. </li>
</ul> <p> Once a transaction has been opened, reading data from a database connection is a simple operation. Using the xRead() method of the file-handle open on the database file, the required database file pages are read one at a time. SQLite never reads partial pages and always uses a single call to xRead() for each required page. </p>
<p> After reading the data for a database page, SQLite stores the raw page of data in the <i>page cache</i>. Each time a page of data is required by the upper layers, the <i>page cache</i> is queried to see if it contains a copy of the required page stored by the current <i>database connection</i>. If such an entry can be found, then the required data is read from the <i>page cache</i> instead of the database file. Only a connection with an open transaction transaction (either a <i>read-only transaction</i> or a <i>read/write transaction</i>) on the database may read data from the <i>page cache</i>. In this sense reading from the <i>page cache</i> is no different to reading from the <i>database file</i>. </p>
<p> Refer to section <cite>page_cache_algorithms</cite> for a description of exactly how and for how long page data is stored in the <i>page cache</i>. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35010"> Except for the read operation required by H35070 and those reads made as part of opening a read-only transaction, SQLite shall ensure that a <i>database connection</i> has an open read-only or read/write transaction when any data is read from the <i>database file</i>. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35020"> Aside from those read operations described by H35070 and H21XXX, SQLite shall read data from the database file in aligned blocks of <i>page-size</i> bytes, where <i>page-size</i> is the database page size used by the database file. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35420"> SQLite shall ensure that a <i>database connection</i> has an open read-only or read/write transaction before using data stored in the <i>page cache</i> to satisfy user queries. </p>
<h2 id="open_read_only_trans">Opening a Read-Only Transaction</h2> <p> Before data may be read from a <i>database file</i> or queried from the <i>page cache</i>, a <i>read-only transaction</i> must be successfully opened by the associated database connection (this is true even if the connection will eventually write to the database, as a <i>read/write transaction</i> may only be opened by upgrading from a <i>read-only transaction</i>). This section describes the procedure for opening a <i>read-only transaction</i>. </p>
<p> The key element of a <i>read-only transaction</i> is that the file-handle open on the database file obtains and holds a <i>shared-lock</i> on the database file. Because a connection requires an <i>exclusive-lock</i> before it may actually modify the contents of the database file, and by definition while one connection is holding a <i>shared-lock</i> no other connection may hold an <i>exclusive-lock</i>, holding a <i>shared-lock</i> guarantees that no other process may modify the database file while the <i>read-only transaction</i> remains open. This ensures that <i>read-only transactions</i> are sufficiently isolated from the transactions of other database users (see section <cite>overview</cite>). </p>
<p>Obtaining the <i>shared lock</i> itself on the database file is quite simple, SQLite just calls the xLock() method of the database file handle. Some of the other processes that take place as part of opening the <i>read-only transaction</i> are quite complex. The steps that SQLite is required to take to open a <i>read-only transaction</i>, in the order in which they must occur, is as follows: </p>
<ol> <li>A <i>shared-lock</i> is obtained on the database file. </li>
<li>The connection checks if a <i>hot journal file</i> exists in the file-system. If one does, then it is rolled back before continuing. </li>
<li>The connection checks if the data in the <i>page cache</i> may still be trusted. If not, all page cache data is discarded. </li>
<li>If the file-size is not zero bytes and the page cache does not contain valid data for the first page of the database, then the data for the first page must be read from the database. </li>
</ol> <p> Of course, an error may occur while attempting any of the 4 steps enumerated above. If this happens, then the <i>shared-lock</i> is released (if it was obtained) and an error returned to the user. Step 2 of the procedure above is described in more detail in section <cite>hot_journal_detection</cite>. Section <cite>cache_validation</cite> describes the process identified by step 3 above. Further detail on step 4 may be found in section <cite>read_page_one</cite>. </p>

<h3 id="hot_journal_detection">Hot Journal Detection</h3> <p> This section describes the procedure that SQLite uses to detect a <i>hot journal file</i>. If a <i>hot journal file</i> is detected, this indicates that at some point the process of writing a transaction to the database was interrupted and a recovery operation (<i>hot journal rollback</i>) needs to take place. This section does not describe the process of <i>hot journal rollback</i> (see section <cite>hot_journal_rollback</cite>) or the processes by which a <i>hot journal file</i> may be created (see section <cite>writing_data</cite>). </p>
<p> The procedure used to detect a <i>hot-journal file</i> is quite complex. The following steps take place: </p>
<ol class="spacedlist"> <li>Using the VFS xAccess() method, SQLite queries the file-system to see if the journal file associated with the database exists. If it does not, then there is no hot-journal file. </li>
<li>By invoking the xCheckReservedLock() method of the file-handle opened on the database file, SQLite checks if some other connection holds a <i>reserved lock</i> or greater. If some other connection does hold a <i>reserved lock</i>, this indicates that the other connection is midway through a <i>read/write transaction</i> (see section <cite>writing_data</cite>). In this case the <i>journal file</i> is not a <i>hot-journal</i> and must not be rolled back. </li>
<li>Using the xFileSize() method of the file-handle opened on the database file, SQLite checks if the database file is 0 bytes in size. If it is, the journal file is not considered to be a <i>hot journal</i> file. Instead of rolling back the journal file, in this case it is deleted from the file-system by calling the VFS xDelete() method. <span class="todo">TODO: Technically, there is a race condition here. This step should be moved to after the exclusive lock is held.</span> </li>
<li>An attempt is made to upgrade to an <i>exclusive lock</i> on the database file. If the attempt fails, then all locks, including the recently obtained <i>shared lock</i> are dropped. The attempt to open a <i>read-only transaction</i> has failed. This occurs when some other connection is also attempting to open a <i>read-only transaction</i> and the attempt to gain the <i>exclusive lock</i> fails because the other connection is also holding a <i>shared lock</i>. It is left to the other connection to roll back the <i>hot journal</i>. <div></div> It is important that the file-handle lock is upgraded directly from <i>shared</i> to <i>exclusive</i> in this case, instead of first upgrading to <i>reserved</i> or pending locks as is required when obtaining an <i>exclusive lock</i> to write to the database file (section <cite>writing_data</cite>). If SQLite were to first upgrade to a <i>reserved</i> or <i>pending</i> lock in this scenario, then a second process also trying to open a <i>read-transaction</i> on the database file might detect the <i>reserved</i> lock in step 2 of this process, conclude that there was no <i>hot journal</i>, and commence reading data from the <i>database file</i>. </li>
<li>The xAccess() method is invoked again to detect if the journal file is still in the file system. If it is, then it is a hot-journal file and SQLite tries to roll it back (see section <cite>rollback</cite>). </li>
</ol> <p class="todo">TODO:  Master journal file pointers? </p>

<h3 id="cache_validation">Cache Validation</h3> <p> When a <i>database connection</i> opens a <i>read transaction</i>, the <i>page cache</i> may already contain data associated with the <i>database connection</i>.

<p> SQLite determines whether or not the <i>page cache</i> entries belonging to the <i>database connection</i> are valid or not using the <i>file change counter</i>, a field in the <i>database file header</i>. The <i>file change counter</i> is a 4-byte big-endian integer field stored starting at byte offset 24 of the <i>database file header</i>. Before the conclusion of a <i>read/write transaction</i> that modifies the contents of the database file in any way (see section <cite>writing_data</cite>), the value stored in the <i>file change counter</i> is incremented. When a <i>database connection</i> unlocks the database file, it stores the current value of the <i>file change counter</i>. Later, while opening a new <i>read-only transaction</i>, SQLite checks the value of the <i>file change counter</i> stored in the database file. If the value has not changed since the database file was unlocked, then the <i>page cache</i> entries can be trusted. If the value has changed, then the <i>page cache</i> entries cannot be trusted and all entries associated with the current <i>database connection</i> are discarded. </p>

If the values are not the same, then SQLite shall conclude that the contents of the cache are invalid. </p>
<p> Requirement H35050 (section <cite>open_read_only_trans</cite>) specifies the action SQLite is required to take upon determining that the cache contents are invalid. </p>
<h3 id="read_page_one">Page 1 and the Expected Page Size</h3> <p> As the last step in opening a <i>read transaction</i> on a database file that is more than 0 bytes in size, SQLite is required to load data for page 1 of the database into the <i>page cache</i>, if it is not already there. This is slightly more complicated than it seems, as the database <i>page-size</i> is no known at this point. </p>
<p> Even though the database <i>page-size</i> cannot be known for sure, SQLite is usually able to guess correctly by assuming it to be equal to the connections <i>expected page size</i>. The <i>expected page size</i> is the value of the <i>page-size</i> field read from the <i>database file header</i> while opening the database connection (see section <cite>open_new_connection</cite>), or the <i>page-size</i> of the database file when the most <i>read transaction</i> was concluded. </p>

<p> See also requirements H35180 and H35210 above. </p>
<h1 id="writing_data">Writing Data</h1> <p> Using DDL or DML SQL statements, SQLite users may modify the contents and size of a database file. Exactly how changes to the logical database are translated to modifications to the database file is described in <cite>ff_sqlitert_requirements</cite>. From the point of view of the sub-systems described in this document, each DDL or DML statement executed results in the contents of zero or more database file pages being overwritten with new data. A DDL or DML statement may also append or truncate one or more pages to or from the end of the database file. One or more DDL and/or DML statements are grouped together to make up a single <i>write transaction</i>. A <i>write transaction</i> is required to have the special properties described in section <cite>overview</cite>; a <i>write transaction</i> must be isolated, durable and atomic. </p>
<p> SQLite accomplishes these goals using the following techniques: </p>
<ul> <li><p> To ensure that <i>write transactions</i> are <b>isolated</b>, before beginning to modify the contents of the database file to reflect the results of a <i>write transaction</i>, SQLite obtains an <i>exclusive lock</i> on the <i>database file</i>. The lock is not relinquished until the <i>write transaction</i> is concluded. Because reading from the <i>database file</i> requires a <i>shared lock</i> (see section <cite>reading_data</cite>) and holding an <i>exclusive lock</i> guarantees that no other <i>database connection</i> is holding or can obtain a <i>shared lock</i>, this ensures that no other connection may read data from the <i>database file</i> at a point when a <i>write transaction</i> has been partially applied. </p></li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that <i>write transactions</i> are <b>atomic</b> is the most complex task required of the system. In this case, <i>atomic</i> means that even if a system failure occurs, an attempt to commit a <i>write transaction</i> to the database file either results in all changes that are a part of the transaction being successfully applied to the database file, or none of the changes are successfully applied. There is no chance that a subset of the changes only are applied. Hence from the point of view of an external observer, the <i>write transaction</i> appears to be an atomic event. </p>
<p> Of course, it is usually not possible to atomically apply all the changes required by a <i>write transaction</i> to a database file within the file-system. For example, if a <i>write transaction</i> requires ten pages of a database file to be modified, and a power outage causes a system failure after sqlite has modified only five pages, then the database file will almost certainly be in an inconsistent state following system recovery. </p>
<p> SQLite solves this problem by using a <i>journal file</i>. In almost all cases, before the <i>database file</i> is modified in any way, SQLite stores sufficient information in the <i>journal file</i> to allow the original the database file to be reconstructed if a system failure occurs while the database file is being updated to reflect the modifications made by the <i>write transaction</i>. Each time SQLite opens a database file, it checks if such a system failure has occurred and, if so, reconstructs the database file based on the contents of the journal file. The procedure used to detect whether or not this process, coined <i>hot journal rollback</i>, is required is described in section <cite>hot_journal_detection</cite>. <i>Hot journal rollback </i> itself is described in section <cite>hot_journal_rollback</cite>. </p>
<p> The same technique ensures that an SQLite database file cannot be corrupted by a system failure that occurs at an inopportune moment. If a system failure does occur before SQLite has had a chance to execute sufficient <i>sync file</i> operations to ensure that the changes that make up a <i>write transaction</i> have made it safely to persistent storage, then the <i>journal file</i> will be used to restore the database to a known good state following system recovery. </p>
</li>
<li><p> So that <i>write transactions</i> are <b>durable</b> in the face of a system failure, SQLite executes a <i>sync file</i> operation on the database file before concluding the <i>write transaction</i> </p></li>
</ul> <p> The <i>page cache</i> is used to buffer modifications to the database file image before they are written to the <i>database file</i>. When the contents of a page is required to be modified as the results of an operation within a <i>write transaction</i>, the modified copy is stored in the <i>page cache</i>. Similarly, if new pages are appended to the end of a database file, they are added to the <i>page cache</i> instead of being immediately written to the database file within the file-system. </p>
<p> Ideally, all changes for an entire write transaction are buffered in the page cache until the end of the transaction. When the user commits the transaction, all changes are applied to the database file in the most efficient way possible, taking into account the assumptions enumerated in section <cite>fs_performance</cite>. Unfortunately, since main-memory is a limited resource, this is not always possible for large transactions. In this case changes are buffered in the <i>page cache</i> until some internal condition or limit is reached, then written out to the database file in order to free resources as they are required. Section <cite>page_cache_algorithms</cite> describes the circumstances under which changes are flushed through to the database file mid-transaction to free <i>page cache</i> resources. </p>
<p> Even if an application or system failure does not occur while a <i>write transaction</i> is in progress, a rollback operation to restore the database file and <i>page cache</i> to the state that it was in before the transaction started may be required. This may occur if the user explicitly requests transaction rollback (by issuing a "ROLLBACK" command), or automatically, as a result of encountering an SQL constraint (see <cite>sql_sqlitert_requirements</cite>). For this reason, the original page content is stored in the <i>journal file</i> before the page is even modified within the <i>page cache</i>. </p>
<p class="todo">TODO:  Introduce the following sub-sections. </p>
<h2 id="journal_file_format">Journal File Format</h2> <p> This section describes the format used by an SQLite <i>journal file</i>. </p>
<p> A journal file consists of one or more <i>journal headers</i>, zero or more <i>journal records</i> and optionally a <i>master journal pointer</i>. Each journal file always begins with a <i>journal header</i>, followed by zero or more <i>journal records</i>. Following this may be a second <i>journal header</i> followed by a second set of zero or more <i>journal records</i> and so on. There is no limit to the number of <i>journal headers</i> a journal file may contain. Following the <i>journal headers</i> and their accompanying sets of <i>journal records</i> may be the optional <i>master journal pointer</i>. Or, the file may simply end following the final <i>journal record</i>. </p>
<p> This section only describes the format of the journal file and the various objects that make it up. But because a journal file may be read by an SQLite process following recovery from a system failure (<i>hot journal rollback</i>, see section <cite>hot_journal_rollback</cite>) it is also important to describe the way the file is created and populated within the file-system using a combination of <i>write file</i>, <i>sync file</i> and <i>truncate file</i> operations. These are described in section <cite>write_transactions</cite>. </p>
<h3 id="journal_header_format">Journal Header Format</h3> <p> A <i>journal header</i> is <i>sector-size</i> bytes in size, where <i> sector-size</i> is the value returned by the xSectorSize method of the file handle opened on the database file. Only the first 28 bytes of the <i>journal header</i> are used, the remainder may contain garbage data. The first 28 bytes of each <i>journal header</i> consists of an eight byte block set to a well-known value, followed by five big-endian 32-bit unsigned integer fields. </p>

</tr>
</table> <p> The set of <i>journal records</i> that follow a <i>journal header</i> in a <i>journal file</i> are packed tightly together. There are no alignment requirements for <i>journal records</i> as there are for <i>journal headers</i>. </p>
<h3>Master Journal Pointer</h3> <p> To support <i>atomic</i> transactions that modify more than one database file, SQLite sometimes includes a <i>master journal pointer</i> record in a <i>journal file</i>. Multiple file transactions are described in section <cite>multifile_transactions</cite>. A <i> master journal pointer</i> contains the name of a <i>master journal-file </i> along with a check-sum and some well known values that allow the <i>master journal pointer</i> to be recognized as such when the <i>journal file</i> is read during a rollback operation (section <cite>rollback</cite>). </p>
<p> As is the case for a <i>journal header</i>, the start of a <i>master journal pointer</i> is always positioned at a <i>sector size</i> aligned offset. If the <i>journal record</i> or <i>journal header</i> that appears immediately before the <i>master journal pointer</i> does not end at an aligned offset, then unused space is left between the end of the <i>journal record</i> or <i>journal header</i> and the start of the <i>master journal pointer</i>. </p>

</table> <h2 id="write_transactions">Write Transactions</h2> <p> This section describes the progression of an SQLite <i>write transaction</i>. From the point of view of the systems described in this document, most <i>write transactions</i> consist of three steps: </p>
<ol> <li><p>The <i>write transaction</i> is opened. This process is described in section <cite>opening_a_write_transaction</cite>. </p></li>
<li>
<p>The end-user executes DML or DDL SQL statements that require the structure of the database file of the database file to be modified. These modifications may be any combination of operations to </p>
<ul>
<li>modify the content of an existing database page, </li>
<li>append a new database page to the database file image, or </li>
<li>truncate (discard) a database page from the end of the database file. </li>
</ul> These operations are described in detail in section <cite>modifying_appending_truncating</cite>. How user DDL or DML SQL statements are mapped to combinations of these three operations is described in <cite>ff_sqlitert_requirements</cite>. </li>
<li><p>The <i>write transaction</i> is concluded and the changes made permanently committed to the database. The process required to commit a transaction is described in section <cite>committing_a_transaction</cite>. </p></li>
</ol> <p> As an alternative to step 3 above, the transaction may be rolled back. Transaction rollback is described in section <cite>rollback</cite>. Finally, it is also important to remember that a <i>write transaction</i> may be interrupted by a <i>system failure</i> at any point. In this case, the contents of the file-system (the <i>database file</i> and <i>journal file</i>) must be left in such a state so as to enable the <i>database file</i> to be restored to the state it was in before the interrupted <i>write transaction</i> was started. This is known as <i>hot journal rollback</i>, and is described in section <cite>hot_journal_rollback</cite>. Section <cite>fs_assumption_details</cite> describes the assumptions made regarding the effects of a <i>system failure</i> on the file-system contents following recovery. </p>
<h3 id="opening_a_write_transaction">Beginning a Write Transaction</h3> <p> Before any database pages may be modified within the <i>page cache</i>, the <i>database connection</i> must open a <i>write transaction</i>. Opening a <i>write transaction</i> requires that the <i>database connection</i> obtains a <i>reserved lock</i> (or greater) on the <i>database file</i>. Because obtaining a <i>reserved lock</i> on a <i>database file</i> guarantees that no other <i>database connection</i> may hold or obtain a <i>reserved lock</i> or greater, it follows that no other <i>database connection</i> may have an open <i>write transaction</i>. </p>
<p> A <i>reserved lock</i> on the <i>database file</i> may be thought of as an exclusive lock on the <i>journal file</i>. No <i>database connection</i> may read from or write to a <i>journal file</i> without a <i>reserved</i> or greater lock on the corresponding <i>database file</i>. </p>
<p> Before opening a <i>write transaction</i>, a <i>database connection</i> must have an open <i>read transaction</i>, opened via the procedure described in section <cite>open_read_only_trans</cite>. This ensures that there is no <i>hot-journal file</i> that needs to be rolled back and that any data stored in the <i>page cache</i> can be trusted. </p>
<p> Once a <i>read transaction</i> has been opened, upgrading to a <i>write transaction</i> is a two step process, as follows: </p>
<ol> <li>A <i>reserved lock</i> is obtained on the <i>database file</i>. </li>
<li>The <i>journal file</i> is opened and created if necessary (using the VFS xOpen method), and a <i>journal file header</i> written to the start of it using a single call to the file handles xWrite method. </li>
</ol> <p> Requirements describing step 1 of the above procedure in detail: </p>
<p class="req" id="H35350"> When required to open a <i>write transaction</i> on the database, SQLite shall first open a <i>read transaction</i>, if the <i>database connection</i> in question has not already opened one. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35360"> When required to open a <i>write transaction</i> on the database, after ensuring a <i>read transaction</i> has already been opened, SQLite shall obtain a <i>reserved lock</i> on the database file by calling the xLock method of the file-handle open on the database file. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35580"> If an attempt to acquire a <i>reserved lock</i> prescribed by requirement H35360 fails, then SQLite shall deem the attempt to open a <i>write transaction</i> to have failed and return an error to the user. </p>
<p> Requirements describing step 2 of the above procedure in detail: </p>
<p class="req" id="H35370"> When required to open a <i>write transaction</i> on the database, after obtaining a <i>reserved lock</i> on the database file, SQLite shall open a read/write file-handle on the corresponding <i>journal file</i>. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35380"> When required to open a <i>write transaction</i> on the database, after opening a file-handle on the <i>journal file</i>, SQLite shall append a <i>journal header</i> to the (currently empty) <i>journal file</i>. </p>
<h4 id="writing_journal_header">Writing a Journal Header</h4> <p> Requirements describing how a <i>journal header</i> is appended to a journal file: </p>
<p class="req" id="H35680"> When required to append a <i>journal header</i> to the <i>journal file</i>, SQLite shall do so by writing a block of <i>sector-size</i> bytes using a single call to the xWrite method of the file-handle open on the <i>journal file</i>. The block of data written shall begin at the smallest sector-size aligned offset at or following the current end of the <i>journal file</i>. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35690"> The first 8 bytes of the <i>journal header</i> required to be written by H35680 shall contain the following values, in order from byte offset 0 to 7: 0xd9, 0xd5, 0x05, 0xf9, 0x20, 0xa1, 0x63 and 0xd7. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35700"> Bytes 8-11 of the <i>journal header</i> required to be written by H35680 shall contain 0x00. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35710"> Bytes 12-15 of the <i>journal header</i> required to be written by H35680 shall contain the number of pages that the database file contained when the current <i>write-transaction</i> was started, formatted as a 4-byte big-endian unsigned integer. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35720"> Bytes 16-19 of the <i>journal header</i> required to be written by H35680 shall contain pseudo-randomly generated values. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35730"> Bytes 20-23 of the <i>journal header</i> required to be written by H35680 shall contain the <i>sector size</i> used by the VFS layer, formatted as a 4-byte big-endian unsigned integer. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35740"> Bytes 24-27 of the <i>journal header</i> required to be written by H35680 shall contain the <i>page size</i> used by the database at the start of the <i>write transaction</i>, formatted as a 4-byte big-endian unsigned integer. </p>
<h3 id="modifying_appending_truncating"> Modifying, Adding or Truncating a Database Page </h3> <p> When the end-user executes a DML or DDL SQL statement to modify the database schema or content, SQLite is required to update the database file image to reflect the new database state. This involves modifying the content of, appending or truncating one of more database file pages. Instead of modifying the database file directly using the VFS interface, changes are first buffered within the <i>page cache</i>. </p>
<p> Before modifying a database page within the <i>page cache</i> that may need to be restored by a rollback operation, the page must be <i>journalled</i>. <i>Journalling a page</i> is the process of copying that pages original data into the journal file so that it can be recovered if the <i>write transaction</i> is rolled back. The process of journalling a page is described in section <cite>journalling_a_page</cite>. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35590"> When required to modify the contents of an existing database page that existed and was not a <i>free-list leaf page</i> when the <i>write transaction</i> was opened, SQLite shall journal the page if it has not already been journalled within the current <i>write transaction</i>. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35600"> When required to modify the contents of an existing database page, SQLite shall update the cached version of the database page content stored as part of the <i>page cache entry</i> associated with the page. </p>
<p> When a new database page is appended to a database file, there is no requirement to add a record to the <i>journal file</i>. If a rollback is required the database file will simply be truncated back to its original size based on the value stored at byte offset 12 of the <i>journal file</i>. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35610"> When required to append a new database page to the database file, SQLite shall create a new <i>page cache entry</i> corresponding to the new page and insert it into the <i>page cache</i>. The <i>dirty flag</i> of the new <i>page cache entry</i> shall be set. </p>
<p> If required to truncate a database page from the end of the database file, the associated <i>page cache entry</i> is discarded. The adjusted size of the database file is stored internally. The database file is not actually truncated until the current <i>write transaction</i> is committed (see section <cite>committing_a_transaction</cite>). </p>
<p class="req" id="H35620"> When required to truncate (remove) a database page that existed and was not a <i>free-list leaf page</i> when the <i>write transaction</i> was opened from the end of a database file, SQLite shall journal the page if it has not already been journalled within the current <i>write transaction</i>. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35630"> When required to truncate a database page from the end of the database file, SQLite shall discard the associated <i>page cache entry</i> from the page cache. </p>
<h4 id="journalling_a_page">Journalling a Database Page</h4> <p> A page is journalled by adding a <i>journal record</i> to the <i> journal file</i>. The format of a <i>journal record</i> is described in section <cite>journal_record_format</cite>. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35270"> When required to <i>journal a database page</i>, SQLite shall first append the <i>page number</i> of the page being journalled to the <i>journal file</i>, formatted as a 4-byte big-endian unsigned integer, using a single call to the xWrite method of the file-handle opened on the journal file. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35280"> When required to <i>journal a database page</i>, if the attempt to append the <i>page number</i> to the journal file is successful, then the current page data (<i>page-size</i> bytes) shall be appended to the journal file, using a single call to the xWrite method of the file-handle opened on the journal file. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35290"> When required to <i>journal a database page</i>, if the attempt to append the current page data to the journal file is successful, then SQLite shall append a 4-byte big-endian integer checksum value to the to the journal file, using a single call to the xWrite method of the file-handle opened on the journal file. </p>
<p> The checksum value written to the <i>journal file</i> immediately after the page data (requirement H35290), is a function of both the page data and the <i>checksum initializer</i> field stored in the <i>journal header</i> (see section <cite>journal_header_format</cite>). Specifically, it is the sum of the <i>checksum initializer</i> and the value of every 200th byte of page data interpreted as an 8-bit unsigned integer, starting with the (<i>page-size</i> % 200)'th byte of page data. For example, if the <i>page-size</i> is 1024 bytes, then a checksum is calculated by adding the values of the bytes at offsets 23, 223, 423, 623, 823 and 1023 (the last byte of the page) together with the value of the <i>checksum initializer</i>. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35300"> The checksum value written to the <i>journal file</i> by the write required by H35290 shall be equal to the sum of the <i>checksum initializer</i> field stored in the <i>journal header</i> (H35700) and every 200th byte of the page data, beginning with the (<i>page-size</i> % 200)th byte. </p>
<p> The '%' character is used in requirement H35300 to represent the modulo operator, just as it is in programming languages such as C, Java and Javascript. </p>
<h3 id="syncing_journal_file">Syncing the Journal File</h3> <p> Even after the original data of a database page has been written into the journal file using calls to the journal file file-handle xWrite method (section <cite>journalling_a_page</cite>), it is still not safe to write to the page within the database file. This is because in the event of a system failure the data written to the journal file may still be corrupted (see section <cite>fs_characteristics</cite>). Before the page can be updated within the database itself, the following procedure takes place: </p>
<ol> <li> The xSync method of the file-handle opened on the journal file is called. This operation ensures that all <i>journal records</i> in the journal file have been written to persistent storage, and that they will not become corrupted as a result of a subsequent system failure. </li>
<li> The <i>journal record count</i> field (see section <cite>journal_header_format</cite>) of the most recently written journal header in the journal file is updated to contain the number of <i>journal records</i> added to the journal file since the header was written. </li>
<li> The xSync method is called again, to ensure that the update to the <i>journal record count</i> has been committed to persistent storage. </li>
</ol> <p> If all three of the steps enumerated above are executed successfully, then it is safe to modify the content of the <i>journalled</i> database pages within the database file itself. The combination of the three steps above is referred to as <i>syncing the journal file</i>. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35750"> When required to <i>sync the journal file</i>, SQLite shall invoke the xSync method of the file handle open on the <i>journal file</i>. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35760"> When required to <i>sync the journal file</i>, after invoking the xSync method as required by H35750, SQLite shall update the <i>record count</i> of the <i>journal header</i> most recently written to the <i>journal file</i>. The 4-byte field shall be updated to contain the number of <i>journal records</i> that have been written to the <i>journal file</i> since the <i>journal header</i> was written, formatted as a 4-byte big-endian unsigned integer. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35770"> When required to <i>sync the journal file</i>, after updating the <i>record count</i> field of a <i>journal header</i> as required by H35760, SQLite shall invoke the xSync method of the file handle open on the <i>journal file</i>. </p>
<h3 id="upgrading_to_exclusive_lock">Upgrading to an Exclusive Lock</h3> <p> Before the content of a page modified within the <i>page cache</i> may be written to the database file, an <i>exclusive lock</i> must be held on the database file. The purpose of this lock is to prevent another connection from reading from the database file while the first connection is midway through writing to it. Whether the reason for writing to the database file is because a transaction is being committed, or to free up space within the <i>page cache</i>, upgrading to an <i>exclusive lock</i> always occurs immediately after <i>syncing the journal file</i>. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35780"> When required to upgrade to an <i>exclusive lock</i> as part of a write transaction, SQLite shall first attempt to obtain a <i>pending lock</i> on the database file if one is not already held by invoking the xLock method of the file handle opened on the <i>database file</i>. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35790"> When required to upgrade to an <i>exclusive lock</i> as part of a write transaction, after successfully obtaining a <i>pending lock</i> SQLite shall attempt to obtain an <i>exclusive lock</i> by invoking the xLock method of the file handle opened on the <i>database file</i>. </p>
<p class="todo">TODO:  What happens if the exclusive lock cannot be obtained? It is not possible for the attempt to upgrade from a reserved to a pending lock to fail. </p>
<h3 id="committing_a_transaction">Committing a Transaction</h3> <p> Committing a <i>write transaction</i> is the final step in updating the database file. Committing a transaction is a seven step process, summarized as follows: </p>
<ol> <li><p> The database file header <i>change counter</i> field is incremented. The <i>change counter</i>, described in <cite>ff_sqlitert_requirements</cite>, is used by the <i>cache validation</i> procedure described in section <cite>cache_validation</cite>. </p></li>
<li><p> The <i>journal file</i> is synced. The steps required to <i>sync the journal file</i> are described in section <cite>syncing_journal_file</cite>. </p></li>
<li><p> Upgrade to an <i>exclusive lock</i> on the database file, if an <i>exclusive lock</i> is not already held. Upgrading to an <i>exclusive lock</i> is described in section <cite>upgrading_to_exclusive_lock</cite>. </p></li>
<li><p> Copy the contents of all <i>dirty pages</i> stored in the <i>page cache</i> into the database file. The set of dirty pages are written to the database file in page number order in order to improve performance (see the assumptions in section <cite>fs_performance</cite> for details). </p></li>
<li><p> The database file is synced to ensure that all updates are stored safely on the persistent media. </p></li>
<li><p> The file-handle open on the <i>journal file</i> is closed and the journal file itself deleted. At this point the <i>write transaction</i> transaction has been irrevocably committed. </p></li>
<li><p> The database file is unlocked. </p></li>
</ol> <p class="todo">TODO:  Expand on and explain the above a bit. </p>
<p> The following requirements describe the steps enumerated above in more detail. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35800"> When required to <i>commit a write-transaction</i>, SQLite shall modify page 1 to increment the value stored in the <i>change counter</i> field of the <i>database file header</i>. </p>
<p> The <i>change counter</i> is a 4-byte big-endian integer field stored at byte offset 24 of the <i>database file</i>. The modification to page 1 required by H35800 is made using the process described in section <cite>modifying_appending_truncating</cite>. If page 1 has not already been journalled as a part of the current write-transaction, then incrementing the <i>change counter</i> may require that page 1 be journalled. In all cases the <i>page cache entry</i> corresponding to page 1 becomes a <i>dirty page</i> as part of incrementing the <i>change counter</i> value. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35810"> When required to <i>commit a write-transaction</i>, after incrementing the <i>change counter</i> field, SQLite shall <i>sync the journal file</i>. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35820"> When required to <i>commit a write-transaction</i>, after <i>syncing the journal file</i> as required by H35810, if an <i>exclusive lock</i> on the database file is not already held, SQLite shall attempt to <i>upgrade to an exclusive lock</i>. </p>

Each call to xWrite shall write the contents of a single <i>dirty page</i> (<i>page-size</i> bytes of data) to the database file. Dirty pages shall be written in order of <i>page number</i>, from lowest to highest. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35840"> When required to <i>commit a write-transaction</i>, after copying the contents of any <i>dirty pages</i> to the database file as required by H35830, SQLite shall sync the database file by invoking the xSync method of the <i>database connection</i> file handle. </p>

<p class="req" id="H35860"> When required to <i>commit a write-transaction</i>, after deleting the <i>journal file</i> as required by H35850, SQLite shall relinquish all locks held on the <i>database file</i> by invoking the xUnlock method of the <i>database connection</i> file handle. </p>
<p class="todo">TODO:  Is the shared lock held after committing a <i>write transaction</i>? </p>
<h3>Purging a Dirty Page</h3> <p> Usually, no data is actually written to the database file until the user commits the active <i>write transaction</i>. The exception is if a single <i>write transaction</i> contains too many modifications to be stored in the <i>page cache</i>. In this case, some of the database file modifications stored in the <i>page cache</i> must be applied to the database file before the transaction is committed so that the associated <i>page cache entries</i> can be purged from the page cache to free memory. Exactly when this condition is reached and dirty pages must be purged is described in section <cite>page_cache_algorithms</cite>. </p>
<p> Before the contents of the <i>page cache entry</i> can be written into the database file, the <i>page cache entry</i> must meet the criteria for a <i>writable dirty page</i>, as defined in section <cite>page_cache_algorithms</cite>. If the dirty page selected by the algorithms in section <cite>page_cache_algorithms</cite> for purging, SQLite is required to <i>sync the journal file</i>. Immediately after the journal file is synced, all dirty pages associated with the <i>database connection</i> are classified as <i>writable dirty pages</i>. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35640"> When required to purge a <i>non-writable dirty page</i> from the <i>page cache</i>, SQLite shall <i>sync the journal file</i> before proceeding with the write operation required by H35670. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35660"> After <i>syncing the journal file</i> as required by H35640, SQLite shall append a new <i>journal header</i> to the <i>journal file</i> before proceeding with the write operation required by H35670. </p>
<p> Appending a new <i>journal header</i> to the journal file is described in section <cite>writing_journal_header</cite>. </p>
<p> Once the dirty page being purged is writable, it is simply written into the database file. </p>
<p class="req" id="H35670"> When required to purge a <i>page cache entry</i> that is a <i>dirty page</i> SQLite shall write the page data into the database file, using a single call to the xWrite method of the <i>database connection</i> file handle. </p>
