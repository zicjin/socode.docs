<h1>SQLite Is Transactional</h1>   <h2>SQLite is Transactional</h2> <p>A transactional database is one in which all changes and queries appear to be Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID</a>). SQLite implements <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serializability">serializable</a> transactions that are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable, even if the transaction is interrupted by a program crash, an operating system crash, or a power failure to the computer. </p> <p> We here restate and amplify the previous sentence for emphasis: All changes within a single transaction in SQLite either occur completely or not at all, even if the act of writing the change out to the disk is interrupted by </p>
<ul> <li>a program crash,</li> <li>an operating system crash, or</li> <li>a power failure.</li> </ul> <p> </p>
<p> The claim of the previous paragraph is extensively checked in the SQLite regression test suite using a special test harness that simulates the effects on a database file of operating system crashes and power failures. </p> <p> <a href="atomiccommit">Additional information</a> </p> <div class="_attribution">
