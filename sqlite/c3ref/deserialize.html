</pre> <p> The sqlite3_deserialize(D,S,P,N,M,F) interface causes the <a href="sqlite3">database connection</a> D to disconnect from database S and then reopen S as an in-memory database based on the serialization contained in P. The serialized database P is N bytes in size. M is the size of the buffer P, which might be larger than N. If M is larger than N, and the SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_READONLY bit is not set in F, then SQLite is permitted to add content to the in-memory database as long as the total size does not exceed M bytes.</p> <p>If the SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_FREEONCLOSE bit is set in F, then SQLite will invoke sqlite3_free() on the serialization buffer when the database connection closes. If the SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_RESIZEABLE bit is set, then SQLite will try to increase the buffer size using sqlite3_realloc64() if writes on the database cause it to grow larger than M bytes.</p> <p>The sqlite3_deserialize() interface will fail with SQLITE_BUSY if the database is currently in a read transaction or is involved in a backup operation.</p> <p>If sqlite3_deserialize(D,S,P,N,M,F) fails for any reason and if the SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_FREEONCLOSE bit is set in argument F, then <a href="free">sqlite3_free()</a> is invoked on argument P prior to returning.</p> <p>This interface is only available if SQLite is compiled with the <a href="../compile#enable_deserialize">SQLITE_ENABLE_DESERIALIZE</a> option. </p>
