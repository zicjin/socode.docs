<h1>Replication as a Backup Solution</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p><a href="../replication/index">Replication</a> can be used to support the <a href="../backing-up-and-restoring/index">backup</a> strategy.</p> <div class="cstm-style redbox">
<p>Replication alone is <em>not</em> sufficient for backup. It assists in protecting against hardware failure on the master server, but does not protect against data loss. An accidental or malicious <code>DROP DATABASE</code> or <code>TRUNCATE TABLE</code> statement will be replicated onto the slaves as well. Care needs to be taken to prevent data getting out of sync between the master and the slave.</p> </div>
<p>Replication is most commonly used to support backups as follows:</p> <ul>
<li>A master server replicates to a slave server </li>
<li>Backups are then run off the slave without any impact on the master. </li>
</ul> <p>Backups can have a significant effect on a server, and a high-availability master may not be able to be stopped, locked or simply handle the extra load of a backup. Running the backup from a slave has the advantage of being able to shutdown or lock the slave and perform a backup without any impact on the primary server.</p> <p>Note that when backing up off a slave server, it is important to ensure that the servers keep the data in sync. See for example <a href="../replication-and-foreign-keys/index">Replication and Foreign Keys</a> for a situation when identical statements can result in different data on a slave and a master.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="see-also">See also</h2> <ul>
