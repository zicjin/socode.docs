<h1>Installing MariaDB Windows ZIP Packages</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>Getting started with ZIP packages on Windows is very straightforward - this distribution includes pre-built database files that can be used right after unpacking the ZIP. </p> <p>You can run mysqld.exe from the command prompt like this:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">  cd &lt;directory-where-zip-was-unpacked&gt;
  bin\mysqld --console
</pre>
<p>However, running MariaDB from the command line in a user session like this covers only the simplest testing scenarios. </p> <p>For any serious purpose, use <a href="../mysql_install_dbexe/index">mysql_install_db.exe</a> to create database instances - it is more secure (disables anonymous user by default, allows setting root password during database creation), and more convenient (can create Windows service, supports user-specified data directory).</p> <p>Note : Starting with <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1043-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.4.3</a>, a pre-built data directory is no longer provided, and users need to run <a href="../mysql_install_dbexe/index">mysql_install_db.exe</a> to create a data directory.</p> <p>For older MariaDB releases, you can follow the instructions in <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/windows-install-archive.html">MySQL documentation on ZIP distributions</a> - this describes the manual process for registering a service and securing the database.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
