<h1>Selectively Skipping Replication of Binlog Events</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted">  <p>Normally, all changes that are logged as events in the <a href="../binary-log/index">binary log</a> are also replicated to all slaves (though still subject to filtering by <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">--replicate-do-xxx</code>, <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">--replicate-ignore-xxx</code>, and similar options). However, sometimes it may be desirable to have certain events be logged into the binlog, but not be replicated to all or a subset of slaves, where the distinction between events that should be replicated or not is under the control of the application making the changes.</p> <p>This could be useful if an application does some replication external to the server outside of the built-in replication, or if it has some data that should not be replicated for whatever reason.</p> <p>This is possible with two new <a href="../server-system-variables/index">system variables</a> introduced in <a href="../what-is-mariadb-55/index">MariaDB 5.5</a>:</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="master-session-variable-skip_replication">Master session variable: @@skip_replication</h2> <p>When the <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-server-system-variables/index#skip_replication">skip_replication</a> variable is set to true, changes are logged into the <a href="../binary-log/index">binary log</a> with the flag <code>@@skip_replication</code> set. Such events will not be replicated by slaves that run with <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">--replicate-events-marked-for-skip</code> set different from its default of <code>REPLICATE</code>.</p> <div class="cstm-style darkheader-nospace-borders-side">

<p>The <code>skip_replication</code> option only has effect if <a href="../binary-log/index">binary logging</a> is enabled and <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-server-system-variables/index#skip_replication">sql_log_bin</a> is true.</p> <p>Attempting to change <code>@@skip_replication</code> in the middle of a transaction will fail; this is to avoid getting half of a transaction replicated while the other half is not replicated.

Default is <code>REPLICATE</code>, to ensure that all changes are replicated to the slave. If set to <code>FILTER_ON_SLAVE</code>, events so marked will be skipped on the slave and not replicated. If set to <code>FILTER_ON_MASTER</code>, the filtering will be done on the master, saving on network bandwidth as the events will not be received by the slave at all.</p> <div class="cstm-style darkheader-nospace-borders-side">

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>replicate_events_marked_for_skip</code> is a dynamic variable (it can be changed without restarting the server), however the slave threads must be stopped when it is changed, otherwise an error will be thrown.</p> </div>
<p>When events are filtered due to <code>@@skip_replication</code>, the filtering happens on the master side; in other words, the event is never sent to the slave. If many events are filtered like this, a slave can sit a long time without receiving any events from the master. This is not a problem in itself, but must be kept in mind when inquiring on the slave about events that are filtered. For example <code>START SLAVE UNTIL &lt;some position&gt;</code> will stop when the first event that is <strong>not</strong> filtered is encountered at the given position or beyond. If the event at the given position is filtered, then the slave thread will only stop when the next non-filtered event is encountered. In effect, if an event is filtered, to the slave it appears that it was never written to the binlog on the master.</p> <p>Note that when events are filtered for a slave, the data in the database will be different on the slave and on the master. It is the responsibility of the application to replicate the data outside of the built-in replication or otherwise ensure consistency of operation. If this is not done, it is possible for replication to encounter, for example, <code><a href="../constraint_type-unique-constraint/index">UNIQUE</a></code> contraint violations or other problems which will cause replication to stop and require manual intervention to fix.</p> <p>The session variable <code>@@skip_replication</code> can be changed without requiring special privileges. This makes it possible for normal applications to control it without requiring <code>SUPER</code> privileges. But it must be kept in mind when using slaves with <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">--replicate-events-marked-for-skip</code> set different from <code>REPLICATE</code>, as it allows any connection to do changes that are not replicated.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="skip_replication-and-sql_log_bin">skip_replication and sql_log_bin</h2> <p><code><a href="../set-sql_log_bin/index">@@sql_log_bin</a></code> and <code>@@skip_replication</code> are somewhat related, as they can both be used to prevent a change on the master from being replicated to the slave. The difference is that with <code>@@skip_replication</code>, changes are still written into the binlog, and replication of the events is only skipped on slaves that explicitly are configured to do so, with <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">--replicate-events-marked-for-skip</code> different from <code>REPLICATE</code>. With <code>@@sql_log_bin</code>, events are not logged into the binlog, and so are not replicated by any slave.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="skip_replication-and-the-binlog">skip_replication and the binlog</h2> <p>When events in the binlog are marked with the <code>@@skip_replication</code> flag, the flag will be preserved if the events are dumped by the <code><a href="../mysqlbinlog/index">mysqlbinlog</a></code> program and re-applied against a server with the <code><a href="../mysql-command-line-client/index">mysql client</a></code> program. Similarly, the <code><a href="../binlog/index">BINLOG</a></code> statement will preserve the flag from the event being replayed. And a slave which runs with <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">--log-slave-updates</code> and does not filter events (<code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">--replicate-events-marked-for-skip=REPLICATE</code>) will also preserve the flag in the events logged into the binlog on the slave.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="see-also">See also</h2> <ul start="1"><li>
