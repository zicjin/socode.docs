<h1>CONNECT - Files Retrieved Using Rest Queries</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>Starting with <a href="../connect/index">CONNECT version 1.07.0001</a>, JSON, XML and possibly CSV data files can be retrieved as results from REST queries when creating or querying such tables. </p> <p>This feature uses the Microsoft Casablanca (cpprestsdk) package. To enable it, first, install the package as explained in <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/cpprestsdk">https://github.com/microsoft/cpprestsdk</a>. Then make the GetRest library (dll or so) as explained in <a href="../connect-making-the-getrest-library/index">Making the GetRest Library</a>.</p> <p>Note: On Windows, the compiled Debug version generated code must be compatible with the <code>cpprest</code> dll called by CONNECT when using REST. If not, this will cause a server crash. If this occurs, recompile CONNECT with Visual Studio after setting the Code Generation Runtime Library to the proper value. It could depend on the way <code>cpprestsdk</code> was installed and most of the time will be /MDd.</p> <p>Note: If you want to use this feature with an older distributed version of MariaDB not featuring REST, it is possible to add it as an OEM module as explained in <a href="../connect-making-the-getrest-library/index">Adding the REST Feature as a Library Called by an OEM Table</a>. </p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="creating-tables-using-rest">Creating Tables using REST</h3> <p>To do so, specify the HTTP of the web client and eventually the URI of the request in the <a href="../create-table/index">CREATE TABLE</a> statement. For example, for a query returning JSON data:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE TABLE webusers (
  id bigint(2) NOT NULL,
  name char(24) NOT NULL,
  username char(16) NOT NULL,
  email char(25) NOT NULL,
  address varchar(256) DEFAULT NULL,
  phone char(21) NOT NULL,
  website char(13) NOT NULL,
  company varchar(256) DEFAULT NULL
) ENGINE=CONNECT DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
TABLE_TYPE=JSON FILE_NAME='users.json' HTTP='http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com' URI='/users';
</pre>
<p>As with standard JSON tables, discovery is possible, meaning that you can leave CONNECT to define the columns by analyzing the JSON file. Here you could just do:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE TABLE webusers
ENGINE=CONNECT DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
TABLE_TYPE=JSON FILE_NAME='users.json'
HTTP='http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com' URI='/users';
</pre>
<p>Note that such tables are read only. In addition, the data will be retrieved from the web each time you query the table with a <a href="../select/index">SELECT</a> statement. This is fine if the result varies each time, such as when you query a weather forecasting site. But if you want to use the retrieved file many times without reloading it, just create another table on the same file without specifying the HTTP option.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
