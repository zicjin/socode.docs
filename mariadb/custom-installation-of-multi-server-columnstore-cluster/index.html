<h1>Custom Installation of Multi-Server ColumnStore Cluster</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted">  <p>If you choose not to do the quick install and chose to customize the various options of installations using a wizard, you may use MariaDB ColumnStore postConfigure script.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="custom-install-wizard-postconfigure">Custom Install Wizard: postConfigure</h2> <p>The postConfigure script is a customer wizard to do the system(server and storage) configuration and setup. Before running the postConfigure script, you must have done <a href="../preparing-for-columnstore-installation-12x/index">Preparing for ColumnStore Installation 1.2.x</a> steps and the pre-requisite validation using <a href="../mariadb-columnstore-cluster-test-tool/index">ColumnStore Cluster Tester Tool</a>. Once you have done these steps, then run the postConfigure script from the node designated as PM1. </p> <p>The script can take several parameters. However, all are optional</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">Usage: postConfigure [-h][-c][-u][-p][-qs][-qm][-qa][-port][-i][-n][-d][-sn][-pm-ip-addrs][-um-ip-addrs][-pm-count][-um-count]

<p>Running postConfigure is a bit different when launching as root user or a non-root user. As a non-root user, you will be required the setup 2 Environment variables and provide the base directory where MariaDB ColumnStore resides.</p> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="running-postconfigure-as-root-user">Running postConfigure as root user</h4> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">/usr/local/mariadb/columnstore/bin/postConfigure

<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="distributed-vs-non-distributed-options">Distributed vs Non-Distributed options</h3> <p>The postConfigure script supports 2 different types of installs:</p> <ul start="1">

It pushes copies of the MariaDB ColumnStore packages from the 'pm1' node where postConfigure is running. During upgrades, it will also make sure the ColumnStore service is stopped and will replace any packages that were previously installed with the new package. Since it pushes the new packages to the other nodes, it is required that the packages be placed in the current home directory of the user doing the install, i.e. /root/ for root user install.</p> <p>Distributed Install does require an additional command line argument "-d" as shown in this example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">/usr/local/mariadb/columnstore/bin/postConfigure -d
</pre>
<h3 class="anchored_heading" id="storage-configuration-options">Storage Configuration Options</h3> <p>When running postConfigure, you will be prompted for the type of storage configuration. Usually the options are 'internal' and 'external'. If GlusterFS is installed, then 'DataRedundancy' will be an option.</p> <p>Check this document to determine which type of storage you will want to select:</p> <p><a href="../library/preparing-for-and-installing-columnstore-version-121/index#storage-and-database-files-dbroots">https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/preparing-for-and-installing-columnstore-version-121/#storage-and-database-files-dbroots</a></p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="common-installation-examples">Common Installation Examples</h3> <p>The following is a transcript of a typical run of the MariaDB ColumnStore configuration script. Plain-text formatting indicates output from the script and bold text indicates responses to questions. After each question, there is a short discussion of what the question is asking and what some typical answers might be. You will not see these during the running the actual configuration script.</p> <p>During postConfigure, there are 2 questions that are asked where the answer given determines the path that postConfigure takes in configuring the system. Those 2 questions are as follows:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">Select the type of server install [1=single, 2=multi] (2) &gt;

<p>The following examples illustrate some common configurations and helps to provide answers to the above questions:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>Single Node - User and Performance running on 1 server - single / combined </li>
<li>Mutli-Node #1 - User and Performance running on some server - multi / combined </li>
<li>Mutli-Node #2 - User and Performance running on separate servers - multi / separate </li>
</ul> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="distributed-install-example">Distributed Install example</h4> <p>This is an example of a Distributed Install of a 1UM/2PM system with internal storage.

This is the MariaDB ColumnStore System Configuration and Installation tool.
It will Configure the MariaDB ColumnStore System and will perform a Package
Installation of all of the Servers within the System that is being configured.

IMPORTANT: This tool should only be run on the Parent OAM Module
           which is a Performance Module, preferred Module #1

Prompting instructions:

	Press 'enter' to accept a value in (), if available or
	Enter one of the options within [], if available, or
	Enter a new value


===== Setup System Server Type Configuration =====

There are 2 options when configuring the System Server Type: single and multi

  'single'  - Single-Server install is used when there will only be 1 server configured
              on the system. It can also be used for production systems, if the plan is
              to stay single-server.

  'multi'   - Multi-Server install is used when you want to configure multiple servers now or
              in the future. With Multi-Server install, you can still configure just 1 server
              now and add on addition servers/modules in the future.

Select the type of System Server install [1=single, 2=multi] (2) &gt; 


===== Setup System Module Type Configuration =====

There are 2 options when configuring the System Module Type: separate and combined

  'separate' - User and Performance functionality on separate servers.

  'combined' - User and Performance functionality on the same server

Select the type of System Module Install [1=separate, 2=combined] (2) &gt; 1

Separate Server Installation will be performed.

NOTE: Local Query Feature allows the ability to query data from a single Performance
      Module. Check MariaDB ColumnStore Admin Guide for additional information.

Enable Local Query feature? [y,n] (n) &gt; 

NOTE: The MariaDB ColumnStore Schema Sync feature will replicate all of the
      schemas and InnoDB tables across the User Module nodes. This feature can be enabled
      or disabled, for example, if you wish to configure your own replication post installation.
