The next step is:

If installing on a pm1 node:

/usr/local/mariadb/columnstore/bin/postConfigure

If installing on a non-pm1 using the non-distributed option:

/usr/local/mariadb/columnstore/bin/columnstore start


Run postConfigure script


This is the MariaDB ColumnStore System Configuration and Installation tool.
It will Configure the MariaDB ColumnStore System and will perform a Package
Installation of all of the Servers within the System that is being configured.

IMPORTANT: This tool requires to run on the Performance Module #1

With the no-Prompting Option being specified, you will be required to have the following:

 1. Root user ssh keys setup between all nodes in the system or
    use the password command line option.
 2. A Configure File to use to retrieve configure data, default to Columnstore.xml.rpmsave
    or use the '-c' option to point to a configuration file.


===== Quick Install Single-Server Configuration =====

Single-Server install is used when there will only be 1 server configured
on the system. It can also be used for production systems, if the plan is
to stay single-server.
