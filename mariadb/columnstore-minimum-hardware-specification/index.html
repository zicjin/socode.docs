<td>Storage</td>
<td>Local disk on each PM can be appropriate for systems that can tolerate some down time in the event of server failure. To leverage the automated fail-over capabilities, a networked storage layer such as SAN for on premise or EBS in AWS is a better choice. A distributed filesystem such as the open source GlusterFS will also allow for node fail-over. The storage system must support files being opened with the O_DIRECT flag as the system utilizes this to optimize block caching and avoid the OS redundantly caching the same blocks.</td>

<td>Network Interconnect</td>
<td>In a multi server deployment data will be passed around via TCP/IP networking. At least a 1G network is recommended.</td>

<h1 class="anchored_heading" id="details">Details</h1> <p>These are minimum recommendations and in general the system will perform better with more hardware:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>More CPU cores and servers will improve query processing response time. </li>
<li>More memory will allow the system to cache more data blocks in memory. We have users running system with anywhere from 64G RAM to 512 G RAM for UM and 32 to 64 G RAM for PM. </li>
<li>Faster network will allow data to flow faster between UM and PM nodes. </li>
<li>SSD's may be used, however the system is optimized towards block streaming which may perform well enough with HDD's for lower cost. </li>
<li>Where it is an option, it is recommended to use bare metal servers for additional performance since ColumnStore will fully consume CPU cores and memory. </li>
<li>In general it makes more sense to use a higher core count / higher memory server for single server or 2 server combined deployments. </li>
<li>In a deployment with multiple UM nodes the system will round robin requests from the mysqld handling the query to any ExeMgr in the cluster for load balancing. A higher bandwidth network such as 10g or 40g will be of benefit for large result set queries. </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="aws-instance-sizes">AWS instance sizes</h2> <p>For AWS our own internal testing generally uses m4.4xlarge instance types as a cost effective middle ground. The R4.8xlarge has also been tested and performs about twice as fast for about twice the price.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
