<h1>Handling Too Many Connections</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>Systems that get too busy can return the <code>too_many_connections</code> error.</p> <p>When the number of <a href="../server-status-variables/index#threads_connected">threads_connected</a> exceeds the <code><a href="../server-system-variables/index#max_connections">max_connections</a></code> server variable, it's time to make a change. Viewing the <a href="../server-status-variables/index#threads_connected">threads_connected</a> status variable shows only the current number of connections, but it's more useful to see what the value has peaked at, and this is shown by the <a href="../server-status-variables/index#max_used_connections">max_used_connections</a> status variable.</p> <p>This error may be a symptom of slow queries and other bottlenecks, but if the system is running smoothly this can be addressed by increasing the value of max_connections.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
