<h1>Delimiters</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>The default delimiter in the <a href="../mysql-client/index">mysql</a> client (from <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1046-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.4.6</a>, <a href="../mariadb-command-line-client/index">also called mariadb</a>) is the semicolon.</p> <p>When creating <a href="../stored-programs-and-views/index">stored programs</a> from the command-line, it is likely you will need to differentiate between the regular delimiter and a delimiter inside a <a href="../begin-end/index">BEGIN END</a> block. To understand better, consider the following example:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE FUNCTION FortyTwo() RETURNS TINYINT DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
 DECLARE x TINYINT;
 SET x = 42;
 RETURN x;
END; 
</pre>
<p>If you enter the above line by line, the mysql client will treat the first semicolon, at the end of the <code class="fixed" style="white-space:pre-wrap">DECLARE x TINYINT</code> line, as the end of the statement. Since that's only a partial definition, it will throw a syntax error, as follows:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE FUNCTION FortyTwo() RETURNS TINYINT DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
DECLARE x TINYINT;
ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; 
check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version
 for the right syntax to use near '' at line 3
</pre>
<p>The solution is to specify a distinct delimiter for the duration of the process, using the DELIMITER command. The delimiter can be any set of characters you choose, but it needs to be a distinctive set of characters that won't cause further confusion. <code>//</code> is a common choice, and used throughout the knowledgebase.</p> <p>Here's how the function could be successfully entered from the mysql client with the new delimiter.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">DELIMITER //

CREATE FUNCTION FortyTwo() RETURNS TINYINT DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
  DECLARE x TINYINT;
  SET x = 42;
  RETURN x;
END 

//

DELIMITER ;
</pre>
<p>At the end, the delimiter is restored to the default semicolon. The <code>\g</code> and <code>\G</code> delimiters can always be used, even when a custom delimiter is specified.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
