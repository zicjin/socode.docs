<h1>ColumnStore LOAD DATA INFILE</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>The LOAD DATA INFILE statement reads rows from a text file into a table at a very high speed. The file name must be given as a literal string.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">LOAD DATA [LOCAL] INFILE 'file_name' 
  INTO TABLE tbl_name
  [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
  [{FIELDS | COLUMNS}
    [TERMINATED BY 'string']
    [[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY 'char']

<ul start="1">
<li>ColumnStore ignores the ON DUPLICATE KEY clause. </li>
<li>Non-transactional LOAD DATA INFILE is directed to ColumnStores cpimport tool by default, which significantly increases performance. </li>
<li>Transactional LOAD DATA INFILE statements (that is with AUTOCOMMIT off or after a START TRANSACTION) are processed through normal DML processes. </li>
<li>When using LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE with the <em>mcsmysql</em> utility , use the <a href="../server-system-variables/index#local_infile">--local-infile</a> command-line option. </li>
<li>Use cpimport for importing UTF-8 data that contains multi-byte values </li>
</ul> <p>The following example loads data into the a simple 5 column table: A file named /simpletable.tbl<em> has the following data in it.</em></p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">1|100|1000|10000|Test Number 1|
2|200|2000|20000|Test Number 2|
3|300|3000|30000|Test Number 3|
</pre>
<p>The data can then be loaded into the simpletable table with the following syntax:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">LOAD DATA INFILE 'simpletable.tbl' INTO TABLE simpletable FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|'
</pre>
<p>If the default mode is set to use cpimport internally any output error files will be written to /usr/local/mariadb/columnstore/mysql/db directory (or equivalent directory for non root install). These can be consulted for troubleshooting any errors reported.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
