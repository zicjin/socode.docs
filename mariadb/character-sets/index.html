<h1> Character Sets and Collations </h1> <div> <div class="creole"> <p>Simply put, a character set defines how and which characters are stored to support a particular language or languages. A collation, on the other hand, defines the order used when comparing strings (i.e. the position of any given character within the alphabet of that language)</p> </div> <table>
