<h1>Compressing Events to Reduce Size of the Binary Log</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <div class="mariadb_from_10_2_3 mariadb from_10_2_3 product">
<strong class="product_title">MariaDB starting with <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1023-release-notes/">10.2.3</a></strong><p>Starting from <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1023-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.2.3</a>, selected events in the <a href="../binary-log/index">binary log</a> can be optionally compressed, to save space in the binary log on disk and in network transfers.</p> </div>
<p>The events that can be compressed are the events that normally can be of a significant size: Query events (for DDL and DML in <a href="../binary-log-formats/index#statement-based">statement-based</a> <a href="../standard-replication/index">replication</a>), and row events (for DML in <a href="../binary-log-formats/index#row-based">row-based</a> <a href="../standard-replication/index">replication</a>).</p> <p>Compression is fully transparent. Events are compressed on the master before being written into the binary log, and are uncompressed by the I/O thread on the slave before being written into the relay log. The <a href="../mysqlbinlog/index">mysqlbinlog</a> command will likewise uncompress events for its output.</p> <p>Currently, the zlib compression algorithm is used to compress events.</p> <p>Compression will have the most impact when events are of a non-negligible size, as each event is compressed individually. For example, batch INSERT statements that insert many rows or large values, or row-based events that touch a number of rows in one query.</p> <p>The <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-server-system-variables/index#log_bin_compress">log_bin_compress</a> option is used to enable compression of events. Only events with data (query text or row data) above a certain size are compressed; the limit is set with the <a href="../replication-and-binary-log-server-system-variables/index#log_bin_compress_min_len">log_bin_compress_min_len</a> option.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
