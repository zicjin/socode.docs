<h1>Installing and Configuring a ColumnStore System using the Google Cloud</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted">  <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="introduction">Introduction</h3> <p>MariaDB ColumnStore can be used a Single Node or a Multi-Node system in the Google Cloud environment. You would follow the setup procedure from the Setup document. This document shows how to set Google Cloud Instances.</p> <p>You will need to have an Google Google account setup to access plus some basic knowledge of accessing and launching Google Cloud Instances. </p> <p>These are the support configuration options:</p> <p>1. Single-Node install</p> <p>2. Multi-Node Install</p> <ul start="1"><li>Setup with User Module and Performance Module functionality on the same Instance(s) </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>Setup with User Module and Performance Module functionality on different Instance(s) </li></ul> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="google-cloud-platform-page">Google Cloud Platform page</h3> <p>1. Create a Project</p> <p>2. Go to Compute Engine Page</p> <p>3. Go to Images page and select and Create an image, recommend Centos 7 is you don't have a preference. If planning a multi-node system, create # number of instances you need for your system. A 1um and 2 pm (3 instances) is a typical setup.</p> <p> a. Machine type - Minimum for testing would be 8 vCPU's, the more cpu and memory you have the better the performance will be.</p> <p> b. SSD disk, minimum 100gb. But this again is based on the size you would need for your database</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="ssh-into-instances">SSH into Instance(s)</h3> <p>Check the Google Cloud Document on the different ways to access the instances using ssh.</p> <p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance">https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance</a></p> <p>Here is a link to the initial setup document that you will need to follow:</p> <p><a href="../mariadb/preparing-for-columnstore-installation">https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/preparing-for-columnstore-installation</a></p> <p>1. Setup on each instance</p> <p> a. It is recommended that ssh-keys be setup for multi-node installs, so that would need to be done on all nodes. 'ssh' is used during the installation process.</p> <p> b. Installed MariaDB ColumnStore dependent packages</p> <p> c. make sure the firewalls are disabled as stated in the Prepare Document.</p> <p>2. On just one of the instance, which will be used as pm1</p> <p> a. Installed MariaDB ColumnStore</p> <p> b. Run postConfigure and configured pm1</p> <p>NOTE: Can you follow the postConfigure install instructions from the Single-Server Install document and the Multi-server Install Document.</p> <p><a href="../mariadb/installing-and-configuring-mariadb-columnstore">https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/installing-and-configuring-mariadb-columnstore</a></p> <p><a href="../mariadb/installing-and-configuring-a-multi-server-columnstore-system">https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/installing-and-configuring-a-multi-server-columnstore-system</a></p> <p>NOTE: When configuring the nodes, use the Internal IP addresses.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
