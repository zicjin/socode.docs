<p>This row will also appear if the PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA is supported but disabled, because the database and its tables will exist (but they will be empty).</p> <p>The <a href="../show-engine/index#show-engine-performance_schema-status">SHOW ENGINE PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA STATUS</a> statement is also available, which shows how much memory is used by the tables and internal buffers.</p> <p>However, the PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA is not a regular storage engine for storing data, it's a mechanism for implementing the <a href="../performance-schema/index">Performance Schema</a> feature.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
