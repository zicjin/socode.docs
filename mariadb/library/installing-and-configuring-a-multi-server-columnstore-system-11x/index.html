This is the MariaDB ColumnStore System Configuration and Installation tool.
It will Configure the MariaDB ColumnStore System and will perform a Package
Installation of all of the Servers within the System that is being configured.

IMPORTANT: This tool requires to run on the Performance Module #1

With the no-Prompting Option being specified, you will be required to have the following:

 1. Root user ssh keys setup between all nodes in the system or
    use the password command line option.
 2. A Configure File to use to retrieve configure data, default to Columnstore.xml.rpmsave
    or use the '-c' option to point to a configuration file.

This is the MariaDB ColumnStore System Configuration and Installation tool.
It will Configure the MariaDB ColumnStore System based on Operator inputs and
will perform a Package Installation of all of the Modules within the
System that is being configured.

IMPORTANT: This tool should only be run on a Performance Module Server,
           preferably Module #1

Instructions:

	Press 'enter' to accept a value in (), if available or
	Enter one of the options within [], if available, or
	Enter a new value


Usage: postConfigure [-h][-c][-u][-p][-s][-port][-i][-n]
   -h  Help
   -c  Config File to use to extract configuration data, default is Columnstore.xml.rpmsave
   -u  Upgrade, Install using the Config File from -c, default to Columnstore.xml.rpmsave
	    If ssh-keys aren't setup, you should provide passwords as command line arguments
   -p  Unix Password, used with no-prompting option
   -s  Single Threaded Remote Install
   -port MariaDB ColumnStore Port Address
   -i Non-root Install directory, Only use for non-root installs

It will push copied of the MariaDB ColumnStore packages from the 'pm1' node where postConfigure is running. During upgrades, it will also make sure the ColumnStore is stopped and will replace any packages that were previously install with the new package. Since it pushed the new packages to the other nodes, it is required that the packages be placed in the current home directory of the user doing the install, i.e. /root/ for root user install.</p> <p>Distributed Install is the default setting, so no additional command line arguments need to be provide. </p> <h4 class="anchored_heading" id="non-distributed-install">Non-Distributed Install</h4> <p>Non-Distributed Install by postConfigure will not have any interaction excluding a ping test during the configuration section to validate the IP address provided. With this option, it is up to the user to install the MariaDB ColumnStore packages on the non-pm1 nodes and startup the ColumnStore service before running postConfigure.</p> <p>Non-Distributed Install does require an additional command line argument to be provided.

===== Setup System Server Type Configuration =====

There are 2 options when configuring the System Server Type: single and multi

  'single'  - Single-Server install is used when there will only be 1 server configured
              on the system. It can also be used for production systems, if the plan is
              to stay single-server.

  'multi'   - Multi-Server install is used when you want to configure multiple servers now or
              in the future. With Multi-Server install, you can still configure just 1 server
              now and add on addition servers/modules in the future.

Select the type of System Server install [1=single, 2=multi] (2) &gt; 


===== Setup System Module Type Configuration =====

              to stay single-server.

  'multi'   - Multi-Server install is used when you want to configure multiple servers now or
              in the future. With Multi-Server install, you can still configure just 1 server
              now and add on addition servers/modules in the future.

Select the type of System Server install [1=single, 2=multi] (2) &gt; 


===== Setup System Module Type Configuration =====
