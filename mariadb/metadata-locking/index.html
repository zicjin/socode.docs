<h1>Metadata Locking</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>MariaDB supports metadata locking. This means that when a transaction (including <a href="../xa-transactions/index">XA transactions</a>) uses a table, it locks its metadata until the end of transaction. Non-transactional tables are also locked, as well as views and objects which are related to locked tables/views (stored functions, triggers, etc). When a connection tries to use a DDL statement (like an <a href="../alter-table/index">ALTER TABLE</a>) which modifies a table that is locked, that connection is queued, and has to wait until it's unlocked. Using savepoints and performing a partial rollback does not release metadata locks.</p> <p><a href="../transactions-lock/index">LOCK TABLES ... WRITE</a> are also queued. Some wrong statements which produce an error may not need to wait for the lock to be freed.</p> <p>The metadata lock's timeout is determined by the value of the <a href="../server-system-variables/index#lock_wait_timeout">lock_wait_timeout</a> server system variable (in seconds). However, note that its default value is 31536000 (1 year, MariaDB &lt;= 10.2.3), or 86400 (1 day, MariaDB &gt;= 10.2.4). If this timeout is exceeded, the following error is returned:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">ERROR 1205 (HY000): Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction
</pre>
<p>If the <a href="../metadata-lock-info/index">metadata_lock_info</a> plugin is installed, the <a href="../information-schema/index">Information Schema</a> <a href="../information-schema-metadata_lock_info-table/index">metadata_lock_info</a> table stores information about existing metadata locks.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="example">Example</h2> <p>Let's use the following MEMORY (non-transactional) table:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">CREATE TABLE t (a INT) ENGINE = MEMORY;
</pre>
<p>Connection 1 starts a transaction, and INSERTs a row into t:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">START TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO t SET a=1;
</pre>
<p><code>t</code>'s metadata is now locked by connection 1. Connection 2 tries to alter <code>t</code>, but has to wait:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">ALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMN b INT;
</pre>
<p>Connection 2's prompt is blocked now.</p> <p>Now connection 1 ends the transaction:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">COMMIT;
</pre>
<p>...and connection 2 finally gets the output of its command:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">Query OK, 1 row affected (35.23 sec)
