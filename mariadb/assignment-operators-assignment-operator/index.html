<h1>Assignment Operator (=)</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="syntax">Syntax</h2> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">identifier = expr
</pre> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="description">Description</h2> <p>The equal sign is used as both an assignment operator in certain contexts, and as a <a href="../equal/index">comparison operator</a>. When used as assignment operator, the value on the right is assigned to the variable (or column, in some contexts) on the left.</p> <p>Since its use can be ambiguous, unlike the <a href="../assignment-operator/index">:= assignment operator</a>, the <em><code>=</code></em> assignment operator cannot be used in all contexts, and is only valid as part of a <a href="../set/index">SET</a> statement, or the SET clause of an <a href="../update/index">UPDATE</a> statement</p> <p>This operator works with both <a href="../user-defined-variables/index">user-defined variables</a> and <a href="../declare-variable/index">local variables</a>.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="examples">Examples</h2> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">UPDATE table_name SET x = 2 WHERE x &gt; 100;
</pre>
<pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SET @x = 1, @y := 2;
