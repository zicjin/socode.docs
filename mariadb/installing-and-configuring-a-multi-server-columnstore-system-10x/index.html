<h1>Installing and Configuring a Multi Server ColumnStore System - 1.0.X</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>After the MariaDB ColumnStore servers have been setup based on the <a href="../preparing-for-columnstore-installation/index">Preparing for Installations</a> document and the required MariaDB ColumnStore Packages have been Installed, use of the following option to configure and install MariaDB ColumnStore:</p> <ul start="1"><li>MariaDB ColumnStore Post Install Script </li></ul> <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The install and setup had you install the packages on the node designed as Performance Module #1, 'pm1'. This is where the install script is run from, 'pm1'</p> <p>If installing on a system where there is a need to multi servers initially planned in the future, you would be a multi server install instead of a single server install.</p> <p>Going from one configuration to another will require a re-installation of the MariaDB ColumnStore software.</p> <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: You can install MariaDB ColumnStore as a root user or non-root user. This is based on how you setup the servers based on "Preparing for Installation Document". If installing as root, you need to be logged in as root user in a root login shell. If you are installing as non-root, you need to be logged in as a non-root user that was setup in the "Preparing for Installation Document".</p>  <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="columnstore-cluster-test-tool">ColumnStore Cluster Test Tool</h2> <p>This tool can be running before doing installation on a single-server or multi-node installs. It will verify the setup of all servers that are going to be used in the Columnstore System.</p> <p><a href="../mariadb/mariadb-columnstore-cluster-test-tool">https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mariadb-columnstore-cluster-test-tool</a></p> <p>The following is a transcript of a typical run of the MariaDB ColumnStore configuration script. Plain-text formatting indicates output from the script and bold text indicates responses to questions. After each question there is a short discussion of what the question is asking and what some typical answers might be. You will not see these discussions the running the actual configuration script.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="mariadb-columnstore-post-install-script-postconfigure">MariaDB ColumnStore Post Install Script, postConfigure</h2> <p>Run the script 'postConfigure' to complete the configuration and installation. This Article shows how to install on a mullti server system.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="common-installation-examples">Common Installation Examples</h3> <p>During postConfigure, there are 2 questions that are asked where the answer given determines the path that postConfigure takes in configuring the system. Those 2 questions are as follows:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">Select the type of server install [1=single, 2=multi] (2) &gt;
</pre>
<p>and</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">Select the Type of Module Install being performed:
1. Separate - User and Performance functionalities on separate servers
2. Combined - User and Performance functionalities on the same server
Enter Server Type ID [1-2] (1) &gt;
</pre>
<p>The following examples illustrates some common configurations and helps to provide answers to the above questions:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>Single Node - User and Performance running on 1 server - single / combined </li>
<li>Mutli-Node #1 - User and Performance running on some server - multi / combined </li>
<li>Mutli-Node #2 - User and Performance running on separate servers - multi / separate </li>

It can also be used for production systems, if the plan is to stay single-server.</p> <p> 'multi' - Multi-Server install is used when you want to configure multiple servers now or in the future. With Multi-Server install, you can still configure just 1 server now and add on addition servers/modules in the future.</p> <p>Select the type of System Server install [1=single, 2=multi] (2) &gt; 2</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="setup-system-module-type-configuration">Setup System Module Type Configuration</h3> <p>There are 2 options when configuring the System Module Type: separate and combined</p> <p> 'separate' - User and Performance functionality on separate servers.</p> <p> 'combined' - User and Performance functionality on the same server</p> <p>Select the type of System Module Install [1=separate, 2=combined] (2) &gt; 1</p> <p>Seperate Server Installation will be performed.</p> <p>NOTE: Local Query Feature allows the ability to query data from a single Performance Module.

<h4 class="anchored_heading" id="mariadb-columnstore-memory-configuration">MariaDB Columnstore Memory Configuration</h4> <p>During the installation process, postConfigure will set the 2 main Memory configuration settings based on the size of memory detected on the local node.</p> <p>The 2 settings are in the MariaDB Columnstore Configuration file, /usr/local/mariadb/columnstore/etc Columnstore.xml. These 2 settings are:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">'NumBlocksPct'   - Performance Module Data cache memory setting

TotalUmMemory  - User Module memory setting, used as temporary memory for joins
</pre>
<p>On a system that has the Performance Module and User Module functionality combined on the same server, this is the default settings:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">NumBlocksPct    - 50% of total memory

TotalUmMemory - 25% of total memory, default maximum the percentage equal to 16G
</pre>
<p>On a system that has the Performance Module and User Module functionality on different servers, this is the default settings:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">NumBlocksPct    - This setting is NOT configured, and the default that the applications will then use is 70%

TotalUmMemory - 50% of total memory 
</pre>
<p>The user can choose to change these settings after the install is completed, if for instance they want to setup more memory for Joins to utilize. On a single server or combined UM/PM server, it is recommended to not have the combination of these 2 settings over 75% of total memory</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
