<h1>Data-at-Rest Encryption Overview</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <div class="mariadb_from_10_1_3 mariadb from_10_1_3 product">
<strong class="product_title">MariaDB starting with <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1013-release-notes/">10.1.3</a></strong><p>Encryption of tables and tablespaces was added in <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1013-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.1.3</a>. There were substantial changes made in <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1014-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.1.4</a>, and the description below applies only to <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1014-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.1.4</a> and later</p> </div> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="overview">Overview</h2> <p>Having tables encrypted makes it almost impossible for someone to access or steal a hard disk and get access to the original data. MariaDB got Data-at-Rest Encryption with <a href="../what-is-mariadb-101/index">MariaDB 10.1</a>. This functionality is also known as "Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)".</p> <p>This assumes that encryption keys are stored on another system.</p> <p>Using encryption has an overhead of roughly <em>3-5%</em>.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="which-storage-engines-does-mariadb-encryption-support">Which Storage Engines Does MariaDB Encryption Support?</h2> <p>MariaDB encryption is fully supported for the <a href="../xtradb-and-innodb/index">XtraDB and InnoDB</a> storage engines. Encryption is also supported for the Aria storage engine, but only for tables created with <code>ROW_FORMAT=PAGE</code> (the default), and for the binary log (replication log).</p> <p>MariaDB allows the user to configure flexibly what to encrypt. In XtraDB or InnoDB, one can choose to encrypt:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>everything â€” all tablespaces (with all tables) </li>
<li>individual tables </li>
<li>everything, excluding individual tables </li>
</ul> <p>Additionally, one can choose to encrypt XtraDB/InnoDB log files (recommended).</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="limitations">Limitations</h2> <p>These limitations exist in the data-at-rest encryption implementation in <a href="../what-is-mariadb-101/index">MariaDB 10.1</a>:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>Only <strong>data</strong> and only <strong>at rest</strong> is encrypted. Metadata (for example <code>.frm</code> files) and data sent to the client are not encrypted (but see <a href="../secure-connections/index">Secure Connections</a>). </li>
<li>Only the MariaDB server knows how to decrypt the data, in particular <ul start="1">
<li>
<a href="../mysqlbinlog/index">mysqlbinlog</a> can read encrypted binary logs only when --read-from-remote-server is used (<a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-8813">MDEV-8813</a>). </li>
<li>
<a href="../percona-xtrabackup/index">Percona XtraBackup</a> cannot back up instances that use encrypted InnoDB. However, MariaDB's fork, <a href="../mariadb-backup/index">MariaDB Backup</a>, can back up encrypted instances. </li>
</ul> </li>
<li>The disk-based <a href="https://galeracluster.com/library/documentation/state-transfer.html#write-set-cache-gcache">Galera gcache</a> is not encrypted in the community version of MariaDB Server (<a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-9639">MDEV-9639</a>). However, this file is encrypted in <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/features/mariadb-enterprise-server/">MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4</a>. </li>
<li>The <a href="../mariadb-audit-plugin/index">Audit plugin</a> cannot create encrypted output. Send it to syslog and configure the protection there instead. </li>
<li>File-based <a href="../general-query-log/index">general query log</a> and <a href="../slow-query-log/index">slow query log</a> cannot be encrypted (<a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-9639">MDEV-9639</a>). </li>
<li>The Aria log is not encrypted (<a href="https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-8587">MDEV-8587</a>). This affects only non-temporary Aria tables though. </li>
<li>The MariaDB <a href="../error-log/index">error log</a> is not encrypted. The error log can contain query text and data in some cases, including crashes, assertion failures, and cases where InnoDB/XtraDB write monitor output to the log to aid in debugging. It can be sent to syslog too, if needed. </li>
</ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="encryption-key-management">Encryption Key Management</h2> <p>MariaDB's data-at-rest encryption requires the use of a <a href="../encryption-key-management/index">key management and encryption plugin</a>. These plugins are responsible both for the management of encryption keys and for the actual encryption and decryption of data.</p> <p>MariaDB supports the use of <a href="../encryption-key-management/index#using-multiple-encryption-keys">multiple encryption keys</a>. Each encryption key uses a 32-bit integer as a key identifier. If the specific plugin supports <a href="../encryption-key-management/index#rotating-keys">key rotation</a>, then encryption keys can also be rotated, which creates a new version of the encryption key.</p> <p>How MariaDB manages encryption keys depends on which encryption key management solution you choose. Currently, MariaDB has three options:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>
<a href="../file-key-management-encryption-plugin/index">File Key Management Plugin</a> </li>
<li>
<a href="../aws-key-management-encryption-plugin/index">AWS Key Management Plugin</a> </li>
<li>
<a href="../eperi-key-management-encryption-plugin/index">Eperi Key Management Plugin</a> </li>
</ul> <p>Once you have an key management and encryption plugin set up and configured for your server, you can begin using encryption options to better secure your data.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="encrypting-data">Encrypting Data</h2> <p>Encryption occurs whenever MariaDB writes pages to disk. Encrypting table data requires that you install a <a href="../encryption-key-management/index">key management and encryption plugin</a>, such as the <a href="../file-key-management-encryption-plugin/index">File Key Management</a> plugin. Once you have a plugin set up and configured, you can enable encryption for your InnoDB and Aria tables.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="encrypting-table-data">Encrypting Table Data</h3> <p>MariaDB supports data-at-rest encryption for InnoDB and Aria storage engines. Additionally, it supports encrypting the <a href="../xtradbinnodb-redo-log/index">InnoDB redo log</a> and internal on-disk temporary tables that use the Aria storage engine..</p> <ul start="1">
<li>
<a href="../encrypting-data-for-innodb-xtradb/index">Encrypting Data for InnoDB/XtraDB</a> </li>
<li>
<a href="../encrypting-data-for-aria/index">Encrypting Data for Aria</a> </li>
</ul> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="encrypting-temporary-files">Encrypting Temporary Files</h3> <p>MariaDB also creates temporary files on disk. For example, a binary log cache will be written to a temporary file if the binary log cache exceeds <code><a href="../replication-and-binary-log-system-variables/index#binlog_cache_size">binlog_cache_size</a></code> or <code><a href="../replication-and-binary-log-system-variables/index#binlog_stmt_cache_size">binlog_stmt_cache_size</a></code>, and temporary files are also often used for filesorts during query execution. Since <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1015-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.1.5</a>, these temporary files can also be encrypted if <a href="../server-system-variables/index#encrypt_tmp_files">encrypt_tmp_files=ON</a> is set.</p> <p>Since <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-10127-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.1.27</a>, <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1029-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.2.9</a> and <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1032-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.3.2</a>, temporary files created internally by InnoDB, such as those used for merge sorts and row logs can also be encrypted if <a href="../xtradbinnodb-server-system-variables/index#innodb_encrypt_log">innodb_encrypt_log=ON</a> is set. These files are encrypted regardless of whether the tables involved are encrypted or not, and regardless of whether <a href="../server-system-variables/index#encrypt_tmp_files">encrypt_tmp_files</a> is set or not.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="encrypting-binary-logs">Encrypting Binary Logs</h3> <p>Since <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1017-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.1.7</a>, MariaDB can also encrypt <a href="../binary-log/index">binary logs</a> (including <a href="../relay-log/index">relay logs</a>).</p> <ul start="1"><li>
<a href="../encrypting-binary-logs/index">Encrypting Binary Logs</a> </li></ul> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="encryption-and-page-compression">Encryption and Page Compression</h2> <p>Data-at-rest encryption and <a href="../compression/index">InnoDB page compression</a> can be used together. When they are used together, data is first compressed, and then it is encrypted. In this case you save space and still have your data protected.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="thanks">Thanks</h2> <ul start="1">
<li>Tablespace encryption was donated to the MariaDB project by Google. </li>
<li>Per-table encryption and key identifier support was donated to the MariaDB project by <a href="http://eperi.de/en">eperi</a>. </li>
