<h1>Installing and Configuring a ColumnStore System using the Amazon AMI</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted">  <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="mariadb-columnstore-ami">MariaDB ColumnStore AMI</h2> <p>The MariaDB ColumnStore AMI is CentOS 7 based with MariaDB ColumnStore GA packages. </p> <p>The MariaDB Columnstore CentOS 7 binary package is installed in the user account:. </p> <ul start="1">
<li>‘mariadb-user’ on MariaDB ColumnStore 1.2.0 and before releases </li>
<li>'mysql' on MariaDB ColumnStore 1.2.1 and later releases </li>
</ul> <p>The user account will be referred to as &lt;USER&gt; within this document.</p> <p>This is a non-root install where the user will access and run all the commands via the user &lt;USER&gt;. The &lt;USER&gt; has been given 'sudo' privileges to run root level commands, which is required due to the fact that the MariaDB ColumnStore applications run some of these commands internally.</p> <p>MariaDB ColumnStore can be used a Single Node or a Multi-Node system. And it supports using both local storage and EBS storage's.</p> <p>You will need to have an AWS account setup to access and use the MariaDB ColumnStore AMI, plus some basic knowledge of accessing and launching AMI's and Instances. </p> <p>These are the support configuration options:</p> <p>1. Single-Node install with or without EBS Storages</p> <p>2. Multi-Node Install with or without EBS Storages</p> <ul start="1"><li>Setup with User Module and Performance Module functionality on the same Instance(s) </li></ul> <ul start="1"><li>Setup with User Module and Performance Module functionality on different Instance(s) </li></ul> <p>Also of note, MariaDB ColumnStore product also allows the user to install the RPMs and Binary packages on Amazon EC2 instances to create a system that performs like a standard hardware install. It's not required to run MariaDB ColumnStore via the use of this AMI. To do so, just follow the install instructions from the Single Serve and Multi Server install guides.</p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="new-installation-and-upgrades">New Installation and upgrades</h3> <p>The AMI is used for creating a new MariaDB ColumnStore. It will either create the Instances and EBS storages needed during startup, or use ones that you have already created and want to utilize.</p> <p>On doing upgrades, you would follow the procedure that is shown in the associated Upgrade Document. </p> <h3 class="anchored_heading" id="amazon-aws-cli-tool-set">Amazon AWS-CLI Tool Set</h3> <p>The MariaDB ColumnStore AMI comes installed with the Amazon AWS-CLI Tool set package, version 1.11.36. The Amazon AWS-CLI Tools provides the capability to the MariaDB ColumnStore to create EC2 Instances and EBS storages. It allows allows for EC2 Instance/node failover, meaning if an EC2 Instance goes down or stops communicating, MariaDB ColumnStore will handle that problem keeping the system functional. This might consist of re-attaching an EBS storage device from the problem EC2 Performance Module to an another Performance Module in the system. Also if a EC2 Instance was to terminate, MariaDB ColumnStore will launch another EC2 Instance in its place. </p> <p>Even though this AMI has the Amazon AWS-CLI Tool set installed, the user has the option to Setup and Configure a MariaDB ColumnStore System using this AMI without the use of these tools and having them disabled. That is discussed later. </p> <p>Here is a complete list of these commands:</p> <p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/index.html#cli-aws-ec2">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/index.html#cli-aws-ec2</a></p> <p>Here is the EC2 API Tools commands that the MariaDB ColumnStore Software calls:</p> <ol start="1">

===== Setup System Server Type Configuration =====

There are 2 options when configuring the System Server Type: single and multi

  'single'  - Single-Server install is used when there will only be 1 server configured
              on the system. It can also be used for production systems, if the plan is
              to stay single-server.

  'multi'   - Multi-Server install is used when you want to configure multiple servers now or
              in the future. With Multi-Server install, you can still configure just 1 server
              now and add on addition servers/modules in the future.
