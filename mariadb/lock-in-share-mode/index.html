<h1>LOCK IN SHARE MODE</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>When <code>LOCK IN SHARE MODE</code> is specified in a <a href="../select/index">SELECT</a> statement, MariaDB will wait until all transactions that have modified the rows are committed. Then, a write lock is acquired. All transactions can read the rows, but if they want to modify them, they have to wait until your transaction is committed.</p> <p>InnoDB/XtraDB supports row-level locking. selected rows can be locked using <code>LOCK IN SHARE MODE</code> or <code>FOR UPDATE</code>. In both cases, a lock is acquired on the rows read by the query, and it will be released when the current transaction is committed.</p> <p>If <code>autocommit</code> is set to 1, the LOCK IN SHARE MODE and <a href="../for-update/index">FOR UPDATE</a> clauses have no effect.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="see-also">See Also</h2> <ul start="1">
