<h1>Identifier Case-sensitivity</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>Whether objects are case-sensitive or not is partly determined by the underlying operating system. Unix-based systems are case-sensitive, Windows is not, while Mac OS X is usually not, but can be if UFS volumes are used.</p> <p>Database, table, table aliases and <a href="../triggers/index">trigger</a> names are affected by the systems case-sensitivity, while index, column, column aliases, <a href="../stored-programs-and-views/index">stored routine</a> and <a href="../events/index">event</a> names are never case sensitive.</p> <p>Log file group name are case sensitive.</p> <p>The <a href="../server-system-variables/index#lower_case_table_names">lower_case_table_names</a> server system variable plays a key role. It determines whether table names, aliases and database names are compared in a case-sensitive manner. If set to 0 (the default on Unix-based systems), table names and aliases and database names are compared in a case-sensitive manner. If set to 1 (the default on Windows), names are stored in lowercase and not compared in a case-sensitive manner. If set to 2 (the default on Mac OS X), names are stored as declared, but compared in lowercase. </p> <p>It is thus possible to make Unix-based systems behave like Windows and ignore case-sensitivity, but the reverse is not true, as the underlying Windows filesystem can not support this.</p> <p>Even on case-insensitive systems, you are required to use the same case consistently within the same statement. The following statement fails, as it refers to the table name in a different case.</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">SELECT * FROM a_table WHERE A_table.id&gt;10;
