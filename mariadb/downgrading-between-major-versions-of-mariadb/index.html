<h1>Downgrading between Major Versions of MariaDB</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>Downgrading MariaDB is not supported. The only reliable way to downgrade is to <a href="../backing-up-and-restoring-databases/index">restore from a full backup</a> made before upgrading, and start the old version of MariaDB.</p> <p>Some people have reported successfully downgrading, but there are many possible things that can go wrong, and downgrading is not tested in any way by the MariaDB developers.</p> <p>Between major releases, there are often substantial changes, even if none of the new features are used. For example, both <a href="../what-is-mariadb-102/index">MariaDB 10.2</a> and <a href="../what-is-mariadb-103/index">MariaDB 10.3</a> introduce new versions of the redo log.</p> <p>Even within minor releases, there may be problems, for example <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-10121-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.1.21</a> fixed a file format incompatibility bug that prevents a downgrade to earlier <a href="../what-is-mariadb-101/index">MariaDB 10.1</a> releases.</p> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
