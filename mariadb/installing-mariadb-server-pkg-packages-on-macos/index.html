<strong class="product_title">MariaDB starting with <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1025-release-notes/">10.2.5</a></strong><p>Starting with <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-1025-release-notes/">MariaDB 10.2.5</a>, a .pkg installer for macOS is available from <a href="http://mariadb.com/downloads">http://mariadb.com/downloads</a></p> </div>
<p>The .pkg installer installs MariaDB Server and, optionally, a launchd service definition to allow the OS to automatically start and manage MariaDB Server.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="installer-behavior">Installer behavior</h2> <p>The installer installs MariaDB Server in a subdirectory of /usr/local/mariadb.</p> <p>You can place /usr/local/mariadb/server/bin in your PATH to always have access to executables distributed in the MariaDB Server package. The basedir of the MariaDB Server installation will depend on the version installed; for 10.2.6, it will be /usr/local/mariadb/mariadb-10.2.6-osx10.12-x86_64, to which a symlink /usr/local/mariadb/server will be created.</p> <p>The MariaDB Server binaries distributed in this package do not read from .cnf files in /etc/. Instead, put .cnf files in /usr/local/mariadb/etc/.</p> <p>If there's an existing service listening on port 3306, the installer will create /usr/local/mariadb/etc/my.cnf with <code>skip-networking</code>. You can edit this file to set an alternate port for MariaDB Server to listen on, or you can remove <code>skip-networking</code> if you have disabled the daemon that had bound port 3306.</p> <p>MariaDB Server will place its socket file at /usr/local/mariadb/data/mariadb.sock and the client tools included in the package will by default look for a socket file at that location.</p> <p>After installation, your MariaDB Server instance will have a "root" user account and a user account named after the username of the user who ran the installer. Both of these accounts use the <a href="../unix_socket-authentication-plugin/index">UNIX_SOCKET Authentication Plugin</a>, which means no password is required to log in. </p> <p>To log in to MariaDB as root, you will need to become root on the OS; the preferred mechanism for this is to use <code>sudo</code>, like this:</p> <pre class="fixed" data-language="sql">sudo /usr/local/mariadb/server/bin/mariadb
</pre>
<p>If you want to be able to connect to MariaDB Server using TCP, you will need to create a new user and give it a password.</p> <p>The daemon's executable is <code>mariadbd</code>, not <code>mysqld</code>. You should take this into account if you have scripts, tools, or workflows that look for processes named "mysqld". You can also invoke <code>mysqld</code> to start the server; edit /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mariadb.server.plist if you want to do that permanently.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="launchd-behavior">launchd behavior</h2> <p>The installer can install a launchd service configuration. This is optional, but it is enabled by default.</p> <p>The service definition causes launchd to automatically start MariaDB Server after installation and when the OS boots.</p> <p>The launchd service configuration file installed by the installer is located at /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mariadb.server.plist. The service definition file uses command-line arguments to <code>mariadbd</code> to control some of its behavior. These will override changes you make in option (.cnf) files.</p> <p>To stop MariaDB Server using launchd, execute <code>sudo launchctl stop com.mariadb.server</code>.</p> <p>To start MariaDB Server using launchd, execute <code>sudo launchctl start com.mariadb.server</code>.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="uninstalling-mariadb-server">Uninstalling MariaDB Server</h2> <p>To remove MariaDB Server, follow these steps:</p> <p>First, stop MariaDB Server and remove the files associated with launchd support, if you installed it (you'll need to do this as root or under sudo):</p> <ul start="1">
<li>
<code>launchctl stop com.mariadb.server</code> </li>
<li>
<code>launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mariadb.server.plist</code> </li>
<li>
<code>rm  /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mariadb.server.plist /usr/local/mariadb/server</code> </li>
<li>
<code>pkgutil --forget com.mariadb.mariadb-server-launchd</code> </li>
</ul> <p>Now, remove files associated with the MariaDB Server package:</p> <ul start="1">
<li>
<code>rm -r /usr/local/mariadb/server/ /usr/local/mariadb/server</code> </li>
<li>If you also want to remove config files, remove <code>/usr/local/mariadb/etc/</code> </li>
<li>If you want to remove the MariaDB Server data directory, remove <code>/usr/local/mariadb/data/</code> </li>
</ul> <p>You can also consult the output of <code>pkgutil --files com.mariadb.mariadb-server-files</code> to see the specific list of files installed by the package.</p> <p>After removing the files you wish to remove, tell pkgutil to forget the MariaDB Server package:</p> <ul start="1"><li><code>pkgutil --forget com.mariadb.mariadb-server-files</code></li></ul> </div>     </div> <div id="content_disclaimer" class="graybox"> Content reproduced on this site is the property of its respective owners, and this content is not reviewed in advance by MariaDB.
