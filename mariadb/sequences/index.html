<p>A sequence is an object that generates a sequence of numeric values, as specified by the <a href="../create-sequence/index">CREATE SEQUENCE</a> statement. Sequences are an alternative to <a href="../auto_increment/index">AUTO_INCREMENT</a> when you want more control over how sequence numbers are generated. </p> <p>Since a <code>SEQUENCE</code> caches values, it can sometimes be faster. Also, you can access the last value generated by all used sequences; it's not subjected to limitations of <a href="../last_insert_id/index">LAST_INSERT_ID( )</a>.</p> <div class="cstm-style greenbox">
<p>This section is about sequence objects. For details about the storage engine, see <a href="../sequence-storage-engine/index">Sequence Storage Engine</a>.</p> </div> </div> <table>
