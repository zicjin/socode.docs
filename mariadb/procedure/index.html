<h1>PROCEDURE</h1> <div> <div class="node creole"> <div class="answer formatted"> <p>The <code>PROCEDURE</code> clause of <a href="../select/index">SELECT</a> passes the whole result set to a Procedure which will process it. These Procedures are not <a href="../stored-procedures/index">Stored Procedures</a>, and can only be written in the C language, so it is necessary to recompile the server.</p> <p>Currently, the only available procedure is <a href="../procedure-analyse/index">ANALYSE</a>, which examines the resultset and suggests the optimal datatypes for each column. It is defined in the <code>sql/sql_analyse.cc</code> file, and can be used as an example to create more Procedures.</p> <p>This clause cannot be used in a <a href="../views/index">view</a>'s definition.</p> <h2 class="anchored_heading" id="see-also">See Also</h2> <ul start="1">
