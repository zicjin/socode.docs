<p>A NIF library contains native implementation of some functions of an Erlang module. The native implemented functions (NIFs) are called like any other functions without any difference to the caller.

<p><strong>Use this functionality with extreme care.</strong></p> <p>A native function is executed as a direct extension of the native code of the VM. Execution is not made in a safe environment.

The terms are of C-type <code><a href="#ERL_NIF_TERM"><span class="code">ERL_NIF_TERM</span></a></code> and can only be read or written using API functions. Most functions to read the content of a term are prefixed <code class="code">enif_get_</code> and usually return <code class="code">true</code> (or <code class="code">false</code>) if the term is of the expected type (or not). The functions to write terms are all prefixed <code class="code">enif_make_</code> and usually return the created <code class="code">ERL_NIF_TERM</code>. There are also some functions to query terms, like <code class="code">enif_is_atom</code>, <code class="code">enif_is_identical</code>, and <code class="code">enif_compare</code>.</p> <p>All terms of type <code class="code">ERL_NIF_TERM</code> belong to an environment of type <code><a href="#ErlNifEnv"><span class="code">ErlNifEnv</span></a></code>.

All API functions that read or write terms has the environment that the term belongs to as the first function argument.</p> </dd> <dt><strong>Binaries</strong></dt> <dd> <p>Terms of type binary are accessed with the help of struct type <code><a href="#ErlNifBinary"><span class="code">ErlNifBinary</span></a></code>, which contains a pointer (<code class="code">data</code>) to the raw binary data and the length (<code class="code">size</code>) of the data in bytes. Both <code class="code">data</code> and <code class="code">size</code> are read-only and are only to be written using calls to API functions. Instances of <code class="code">ErlNifBinary</code> are, however, always allocated by the user (usually as local variables).</p> <p>The raw data pointed to by <code class="code">data</code> is only mutable after a call to <code><a href="#enif_alloc_binary"> <span class="code">enif_alloc_binary</span></a></code> or <code><a href="#enif_realloc_binary"> <span class="code">enif_realloc_binary</span></a></code>. All other functions that operate on a binary leave the data as read-only. A mutable binary must in the end either be freed with <code><a href="#enif_release_binary"> <span class="code">enif_release_binary</span></a></code> or made read-only by transferring it to an Erlang term with <code><a href="#enif_make_binary"><span class="code">enif_make_binary</span></a></code>.

Read-only binaries do not have to be released.</p> <p><code><a href="#enif_make_new_binary"> <span class="code">enif_make_new_binary</span></a></code> can be used as a shortcut to allocate and return a binary in the same NIF call.</p> <p>Binaries are sequences of whole bytes. Bitstrings with an arbitrary bit length have no support yet.</p> </dd> <dt><strong id="resource_objects">Resource objects</strong></dt> <dd> <p>The use of resource objects is a safe way to return pointers to native data structures from a NIF. A resource object is only a block of memory allocated with <code><a href="#enif_alloc_resource"> <span class="code">enif_alloc_resource</span></a></code>. A handle ("safe pointer") to this memory block can then be returned to Erlang by the use of <code><a href="#enif_make_resource"> <span class="code">enif_make_resource</span></a></code>. The term returned by <code class="code">enif_make_resource</code> is opaque in nature. It can be stored and passed between processes, but the only real end usage is to pass it back as an argument to a NIF. The NIF can then call <code><a href="#enif_get_resource"> <span class="code">enif_get_resource</span></a></code> and get back a pointer to the memory block, which is guaranteed to still be valid. A resource object is not deallocated until the last handle term is garbage collected by the VM and the resource is released with <code><a href="#enif_release_resource"> <span class="code">enif_release_resource</span></a></code> (not necessarily in that order).</p> <p>All resource objects are created as instances of some <strong>resource type</strong>. This makes resources from different modules to be distinguishable. A resource type is created by calling <code><a href="#enif_open_resource_type"> <span class="code">enif_open_resource_type</span></a></code> when a library is loaded. Objects of that resource type can then later be allocated and <code class="code">enif_get_resource</code> verifies that the resource is of the expected type. A resource type can have a user-supplied destructor function, which is automatically called when resources of that type are released (by either the garbage collector or <code class="code">enif_release_resource</code>). Resource types are uniquely identified by a supplied name string and the name of the implementing module.</p>  <p id="enif_resource_example">The following is a template example of how to create and return a resource object.</p> <pre data-language="erlang">ERL_NIF_TERM term;

return term;</pre> <p>Notice that once <code class="code">enif_make_resource</code> creates the term to return to Erlang, the code can choose to either keep its own native pointer to the allocated struct and release it later, or release it immediately and rely only on the garbage collector to deallocate the resource object eventually when it collects the term.</p> <p>Another use of resource objects is to create binary terms with user-defined memory management. <code><a href="#enif_make_resource_binary"> <span class="code">enif_make_resource_binary</span></a></code> creates a binary term that is connected to a resource object. The destructor of the resource is called when the binary is garbage collected, at which time the binary data can be released. An example of this can be a binary term consisting of data from a <code class="code">mmap</code>'ed file. The destructor can then do <code class="code">munmap</code> to release the memory region.</p> <p>Resource types support upgrade in runtime by allowing a loaded NIF library to take over an already existing resource type and by that "inherit" all existing objects of that type. The destructor of the new library is thereafter called for the inherited objects and the library with the old destructor function can be safely unloaded. Existing resource objects, of a module that is upgraded, must either be deleted or taken over by the new NIF library. The unloading of a library is postponed as long as there exist resource objects with a destructor function in the library.</p> </dd> <dt><strong>Module upgrade and static data</strong></dt> <dd> <p>A loaded NIF library is tied to the Erlang module instance that loaded it. If the module is upgraded, the new module instance needs to load its own NIF library (or maybe choose not to). The new module instance can, however, choose to load the exact same NIF library as the old code if it wants to. Sharing the dynamic library means that static data defined by the library is shared as well. To avoid unintentionally shared static data between module instances, each Erlang module version can keep its own private data. This private data can be set when the NIF library is loaded and later retrieved by calling <code><a href="#enif_priv_data"><span class="code">enif_priv_data</span></a></code>.</p> </dd> <dt><strong>Threads and concurrency</strong></dt> <dd> <p>A NIF is thread-safe without any explicit synchronization as long as it acts as a pure function and only reads the supplied arguments. When you write to a shared state either through static variables or <code><a href="#enif_priv_data"> <span class="code">enif_priv_data</span></a></code>, you need to supply your own explicit synchronization. This includes terms in process independent environments that are shared between threads. Resource objects also require synchronization if you treat them as mutable.</p> <p>The library initialization callbacks <code class="code">load</code> and <code class="code">upgrade</code> are thread-safe even for shared state data.</p> </dd> <dt><strong id="version_management">Version Management</strong></dt> <dd> <p>When a NIF library is built, information about the NIF API version is compiled into the library.

It is difficult to give an exact maximum amount of time that a native function is allowed to work, but usually a well-behaving native function is to return to its caller within 1 millisecond. This can be achieved using different approaches. If you have full control over the code to execute in the native function, the best approach is to divide the work into multiple chunks of work and call the native function multiple times. This is, however, not always possible, for example when calling third-party libraries.</p> <p>The <code><a href="#enif_consume_timeslice"> <span class="code">enif_consume_timeslice()</span></a></code> function can be used to inform the runtime system about the length of the NIF call. It is typically always to be used unless the NIF executes very fast.</p> <p>If the NIF call is too lengthy, this must be handled in one of the following ways to avoid degraded responsiveness, scheduler load balancing problems, and other strange behaviors:</p> <dl> <dt><strong>Yielding NIF</strong></dt> <dd> <p>If the functionality of a long-running NIF can be split so that its work can be achieved through a series of shorter NIF calls, the application has two options:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Make that series of NIF calls from the Erlang level.</p> </li> <li> <p>Call a NIF that first performs a chunk of the work, then invokes the <code><a href="#enif_schedule_nif"> <span class="code">enif_schedule_nif</span></a></code> function to schedule another NIF call to perform the next chunk. The final call scheduled in this manner can then return the overall result.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Breaking up a long-running function in this manner enables the VM to regain control between calls to the NIFs.</p> <p>This approach is always preferred over the other alternatives described below. This both from a performance perspective and a system characteristics perspective.</p> </dd> <dt><strong>Threaded NIF</strong></dt> <dd> <p>This is accomplished by dispatching the work to another thread managed by the NIF library, return from the NIF, and wait for the result. The thread can send the result back to the Erlang process using <code><a href="#enif_send"> <span class="code">enif_send</span></a></code>. Information about thread primitives is provided below.</p> </dd> <dt><strong id="dirty_nifs">Dirty NIF</strong></dt> <dd> <p>A NIF that cannot be split and cannot execute in a millisecond or less is called a "dirty NIF", as it performs work that the ordinary schedulers of the Erlang runtime system cannot handle cleanly. Applications that make use of such functions must indicate to the runtime that the functions are dirty so they can be handled specially. This is handled by executing dirty jobs on a separate set of schedulers called dirty schedulers. A dirty NIF executing on a dirty scheduler does not have the same duration restriction as a normal NIF. </p> <p> It is important to classify the dirty job correct. An I/O bound job should be classified as such, and a CPU bound job should be classified as such. If you should classify CPU bound jobs as I/O bound jobs, dirty I/O schedulers might starve ordinary schedulers. I/O bound jobs are expected to either block waiting for I/O, and/or spend a limited amount of time moving data. </p> <p> To schedule a dirty NIF for execution, the application has two options:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Set the appropriate flags value for the dirty NIF in its <code><a href="#ErlNifFunc"> <span class="code">ErlNifFunc</span></a></code> entry.</p> </li> <li> <p>Call <code><a href="#enif_schedule_nif"> <span class="code">enif_schedule_nif</span></a></code>, pass to it a pointer to the dirty NIF to be executed, and indicate with argument <code class="code">flags</code> whether it expects the operation to be CPU-bound or I/O-bound.</p> </li> </ul> <p>A job that alternates between I/O bound and CPU bound can be reclassified and rescheduled using <code class="code">enif_schedule_nif</code> so that it executes on the correct type of dirty scheduler at all times. For more information see the documentation of the <code class="code">erl(1)</code> command line arguments <code><a href="erl#+SDcpu"><span class="code">+SDcpu</span></a></code>, and <code><a href="erl#+SDio"><span class="code">+SDio</span></a></code>.</p> <p>While a process executes a dirty NIF, some operations that communicate with it can take a very long time to complete. Suspend or garbage collection of a process executing a dirty NIF cannot be done until the dirty NIF has returned. Thus, other processes waiting for such operations to complete might have to wait for a very long time. Blocking multi-scheduling, that is, calling <code><a href="erlang#system_flag_multi_scheduling"> <span class="code">erlang:system_flag(multi_scheduling, block)</span></a></code>, can also take a very long time to complete. This is because all ongoing dirty operations on all dirty schedulers must complete before the block operation can complete.</p> <p>Many operations communicating with a process executing a dirty NIF can, however, complete while it executes the dirty NIF. For example, retrieving information about it through <code><a href="erlang#process_info-1"> <span class="code">process_info</span></a></code>, setting its group leader, register/unregister its name, and so on.</p> <p>Termination of a process executing a dirty NIF can only be completed up to a certain point while it executes the dirty NIF. All Erlang resources, such as its registered name and its ETS tables, are released. All links and monitors are triggered. The execution of the NIF is, however, <strong>not</strong> stopped. The NIF can safely continue execution, allocate heap memory, and so on, but it is of course better to stop executing as soon as possible. The NIF can check whether a current process is alive using <code><a href="#enif_is_current_process_alive"> <span class="code">enif_is_current_process_alive</span></a></code>. Communication using <code><a href="#enif_send"><span class="code">enif_send</span></a></code> and <code><a href="#enif_port_command"> <span class="code">enif_port_command</span></a></code> is also dropped when the sending process is not alive. Deallocation of certain internal resources, such as process heap and process control block, is delayed until the dirty NIF has completed.</p> </dd> </dl> </dd> </dl>  </div> <div class="innertube"> <h2><span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-initialization-idm23771').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-initialization-idm23771').style.visibility = 'hidden';">Initialization</span></h2>  <dl> <dt><strong><code class="code" id="ERL_NIF_INIT">ERL_NIF_INIT(MODULE, ErlNifFunc funcs[], load, NULL, upgrade, unload)</code></strong></dt> <dd> <p>This is the magic macro to initialize a NIF library.

This safe way of closing event objects must be used even if all notifications have been received (or cancelled) and no further calls to <code class="code">enif_select</code> have been made. <code class="code">ERL_NIF_SELECT_STOP</code> will first cancel any selected events before it calls or schedules the <code class="code">stop</code> callback.
