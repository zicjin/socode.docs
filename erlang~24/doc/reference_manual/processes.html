If the alias is created together with a monitor, the same reference will be used both as monitor reference and alias. Creating a monitor and an alias at the same time is done by passing the <code class="code">{alias, _}</code> option to the <code><span class="code">monitor/3</span></code> BIF.

Terminating processes emit exit signals to all linked processes, which can terminate as well or handle the exit in some way. This feature can be used to build hierarchical program structures where some processes are supervising other processes, for example, restarting them if they terminate abnormally.</p> <p>See <code> OTP Design Principles</code> for more information about OTP supervision trees, which use this feature.</p> <h4> <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-sending-exit-signals-idm3549').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-sending-exit-signals-idm3549').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="sending_exit_signals">Sending Exit Signals</span> </h4> <p> When a process or port <code><a href="#term">terminates</a></code> it will send exit signals to all processes and ports that it is <code><a href="#links">linked</a></code> to.
