Suppose for example, that you have the following C functions that you would like to call from Erlang:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">/* complex.c */

int foo(int x) {
  return x+1;
}

int bar(int y) {
  return y*2;
}</pre> <p>The functions are deliberately kept as simple as possible, for readability reasons.</p> <p>From an Erlang perspective, it is preferable to be able to call <code class="code">foo</code> and <code class="code">bar</code> without having to bother about that they are C functions:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">
% Erlang code
...
Res = complex:foo(X),
...</pre> <p>Here, the communication with C is hidden in the implementation of <code class="code">complex.erl</code>. In the following sections, it is shown how this module can be implemented using the different interoperability mechanisms.</p> </div> <div class="footer"> <hr> <p>Copyright Â© 2000-2021 Ericsson AB.
