In this section, they are called <strong>binaries</strong> because that is what they are called in the emulator source code.</p> <p>Four types of binary objects are available internally:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Two are containers for binary data and are called:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Refc binaries</strong> (short for <strong>reference-counted binaries</strong>)</li> <li><strong>Heap binaries</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Two are merely references to a part of a binary and are called:</p> <ul> <li><strong>sub binaries</strong></li> <li><strong>match contexts</strong></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h4> <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-refc-binaries-idm262').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-refc-binaries-idm262').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="refc_binary">Refc Binaries</span> </h4> <p>Refc binaries consist of two parts:</p> <ul> <li>An object stored on the process heap, called a <strong>ProcBin</strong> </li> <li>The binary object itself, stored outside all process heaps</li> </ul> <p>The binary object can be referenced by any number of ProcBins from any number of processes. The object contains a reference counter to keep track of the number of references, so that it can be removed when the last reference disappears.</p> <p>All ProcBin objects in a process are part of a linked list, so that the garbage collector can keep track of them and decrement the reference counters in the binary when a ProcBin disappears.</p> <h4> <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-heap-binaries-idm272').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-heap-binaries-idm272').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="heap_binary">Heap Binaries</span> </h4> <p>Heap binaries are small binaries, up to 64 bytes, and are stored directly on the process heap. They are copied when the process is garbage-collected and when they are sent as a message. They do not require any special handling by the garbage collector.</p> <h4><span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-sub-binaries-idm276').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-sub-binaries-idm276').style.visibility = 'hidden';">Sub Binaries</span></h4> <p>The reference objects <strong>sub binaries</strong> and <strong>match contexts</strong> can reference part of a refc binary or heap binary.</p> <p>A <strong id="sub_binary">sub binary</strong> is created by <code class="code">split_binary/2</code> and when a binary is matched out in a binary pattern. A sub binary is a reference into a part of another binary (refc or heap binary, but never into another sub binary). Therefore, matching out a binary is relatively cheap because the actual binary data is never copied.</p> <h4><span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-match-context-idm285').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-match-context-idm285').style.visibility = 'hidden';">Match Context</span></h4>  <p id="match_context">A <strong>match context</strong> is similar to a sub binary, but is optimized for binary matching. For example, it contains a direct pointer to the binary data. For each field that is matched out of a binary, the position in the match context is incremented.</p> <p>The compiler tries to avoid generating code that creates a sub binary, only to shortly afterwards create a new match context and discard the sub binary. Instead of creating a sub binary, the match context is kept.</p> <p>The compiler can only do this optimization if it knows that the match context will not be shared. If it would be shared, the functional properties (also called referential transparency) of Erlang would break.</p> <h2><span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-constructing-binaries-idm292').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-constructing-binaries-idm292').style.visibility = 'hidden';">4.2 Constructing Binaries</span></h2> <p>Appending to a binary or bitstring is specially optimized by the <strong>runtime system</strong>:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">&lt;&lt;Binary/binary, ...&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Binary/bitstring, ...&gt;&gt;</pre> <p>As the runtime system handles the optimization (instead of the compiler), there are very few circumstances in which the optimization does not work.</p> <p>To explain how it works, let us examine the following code line by line:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">Bin0 = &lt;&lt;0&gt;&gt;,                    %% 1
Bin1 = &lt;&lt;Bin0/binary,1,2,3&gt;&gt;,    %% 2
Bin2 = &lt;&lt;Bin1/binary,4,5,6&gt;&gt;,    %% 3
Bin3 = &lt;&lt;Bin2/binary,7,8,9&gt;&gt;,    %% 4
Bin4 = &lt;&lt;Bin1/binary,17&gt;&gt;,       %% 5 !!!
{Bin4,Bin3}                      %% 6</pre> <ul> <li>Line 1 (marked with the <code class="code">%% 1</code> comment), assigns a <code><a href="#heap_binary">heap binary</a></code> to the <code class="code">Bin0</code> variable.</li> <li>Line 2 is an append operation. As <code class="code">Bin0</code> has not been involved in an append operation, a new <code><a href="#refc_binary">refc binary</a></code> is created and the contents of <code class="code">Bin0</code> is copied into it. The <strong>ProcBin</strong> part of the refc binary has its size set to the size of the data stored in the binary, while the binary object has extra space allocated. The size of the binary object is either twice the size of <code class="code">Bin1</code> or 256, whichever is larger. In this case it is 256.</li> <li>Line 3 is more interesting. <code class="code">Bin1</code> <strong>has</strong> been used in an append operation, and it has 252 bytes of unused storage at the end, so the 3 new bytes are stored there.</li> <li>Line 4. The same applies here. There are 249 bytes left, so there is no problem storing another 3 bytes.</li> <li>Line 5. Here, something <strong>interesting</strong> happens. Notice that the result is not appended to the previous result in <code class="code">Bin3</code>, but to <code class="code">Bin1</code>. It is expected that <code class="code">Bin4</code> will be assigned the value <code class="code">&lt;&lt;0,1,2,3,17&gt;&gt;</code>. It is also expected that <code class="code">Bin3</code> will retain its value (<code class="code">&lt;&lt;0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9&gt;&gt;</code>). Clearly, the runtime system cannot write byte <code class="code">17</code> into the binary, because that would change the value of <code class="code">Bin3</code> to <code class="code">&lt;&lt;0,1,2,3,4,17,6,7,8,9&gt;&gt;</code>.</li> </ul> <p>The runtime system sees that <code class="code">Bin1</code> is the result from a previous append operation (not from the latest append operation), so it <strong>copies</strong> the contents of <code class="code">Bin1</code> to a new binary, reserve extra storage, and so on. (Here is not explained how the runtime system can know that it is not allowed to write into <code class="code">Bin1</code>; it is left as an exercise to the curious reader to figure out how it is done by reading the emulator sources, primarily <code class="code">erl_bits.c</code>.)</p> <h4><span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-circumstances-that-force-copying-idm332').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-circumstances-that-force-copying-idm332').style.visibility = 'hidden';">Circumstances That Force Copying</span></h4> <p>The optimization of the binary append operation requires that there is a <strong>single</strong> ProcBin and a <strong>single reference</strong> to the ProcBin for the binary. The reason is that the binary object can be moved (reallocated) during an append operation, and when that happens, the pointer in the ProcBin must be updated. If there would be more than one ProcBin pointing to the binary object, it would not be possible to find and update all of them.</p> <p>Therefore, certain operations on a binary mark it so that any future append operation will be forced to copy the binary. In most cases, the binary object will be shrunk at the same time to reclaim the extra space allocated for growing.</p> <p>When appending to a binary as follows, only the binary returned from the latest append operation will support further cheap append operations:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">Bin = &lt;&lt;Bin0,...&gt;&gt;</pre> <p>In the code fragment in the beginning of this section, appending to <code class="code">Bin</code> will be cheap, while appending to <code class="code">Bin0</code> will force the creation of a new binary and copying of the contents of <code class="code">Bin0</code>.</p> <p>If a binary is sent as a message to a process or port, the binary will be shrunk and any further append operation will copy the binary data into a new binary. For example, in the following code fragment <code class="code">Bin1</code> will be copied in the third line:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">Bin1 = &lt;&lt;Bin0,...&gt;&gt;,
PortOrPid ! Bin1,
Bin = &lt;&lt;Bin1,...&gt;&gt;  %% Bin1 will be COPIED</pre> <p>The same happens if you insert a binary into an Ets table, send it to a port using <code class="code">erlang:port_command/2</code>, or pass it to <code>enif_inspect_binary</code> in a NIF.</p> <p>Matching a binary will also cause it to shrink and the next append operation will copy the binary data:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">Bin1 = &lt;&lt;Bin0,...&gt;&gt;,
&lt;&lt;X,Y,Z,T/binary&gt;&gt; = Bin1,
Bin = &lt;&lt;Bin1,...&gt;&gt;  %% Bin1 will be COPIED</pre> <p>The reason is that a <code><a href="#match_context">match context</a></code> contains a direct pointer to the binary data.</p> <p>If a process simply keeps binaries (either in "loop data" or in the process dictionary), the garbage collector can eventually shrink the binaries. If only one such binary is kept, it will not be shrunk. If the process later appends to a binary that has been shrunk, the binary object will be reallocated to make place for the data to be appended.</p> <h2><span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-matching-binaries-idm355').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-matching-binaries-idm355').style.visibility = 'hidden';">4.3 Matching Binaries</span></h2> <p>Let us revisit the example in the beginning of the previous section:</p> <p><strong>DO</strong></p> <pre data-language="erlang">my_binary_to_list(&lt;&lt;H,T/binary&gt;&gt;) -&gt;
    [H|my_binary_to_list(T)];
my_binary_to_list(&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;) -&gt; [].</pre> <p>The first time <code class="code">my_binary_to_list/1</code> is called, a <code><a href="#match_context">match context</a></code> is created. The match context points to the first byte of the binary. 1 byte is matched out and the match context is updated to point to the second byte in the binary.</p> <p>At this point it would make sense to create a <code><a href="#sub_binary">sub binary</a></code>, but in this particular example the compiler sees that there will soon be a call to a function (in this case, to <code class="code">my_binary_to_list/1</code> itself) that immediately will create a new match context and discard the sub binary.</p> <p>Therefore <code class="code">my_binary_to_list/1</code> calls itself with the match context instead of with a sub binary. The instruction that initializes the matching operation basically does nothing when it sees that it was passed a match context instead of a binary.</p> <p>When the end of the binary is reached and the second clause matches, the match context will simply be discarded (removed in the next garbage collection, as there is no longer any reference to it).</p> <p>To summarize, <code class="code">my_binary_to_list/1</code> only needs to create <strong>one</strong> match context and no sub binaries.</p> <p>Notice that the match context in <code class="code">my_binary_to_list/1</code> was discarded when the entire binary had been traversed. What happens if the iteration stops before it has reached the end of the binary? Will the optimization still work?</p> <pre data-language="erlang">after_zero(&lt;&lt;0,T/binary&gt;&gt;) -&gt;
    T;

    after_zero(T);

after_zero(&lt;&lt;_,T/binary&gt;&gt;) -&gt;
    after_zero(T);
...</pre> <p>But it will generate code that builds a sub binary in the first clause:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">after_zero(&lt;&lt;0,T/binary&gt;&gt;) -&gt;
    T;
...</pre> <p>Therefore, <code class="code">after_zero/1</code> builds one match context and one sub binary (assuming it is passed a binary that contains a zero byte).</p> <p>Code like the following will also be optimized:</p> <pre data-language="erlang">all_but_zeroes_to_list(Buffer, Acc, 0) -&gt;
    {lists:reverse(Acc),Buffer};
all_but_zeroes_to_list(&lt;&lt;0,T/binary&gt;&gt;, Acc, Remaining) -&gt;

all_but_zeroes_to_list(&lt;&lt;Byte,T/binary&gt;&gt;, Acc, Remaining) -&gt;
    all_but_zeroes_to_list(T, [Byte|Acc], Remaining-1).</pre> <p>The compiler removes building of sub binaries in the second and third clauses, and it adds an instruction to the first clause that converts <code class="code">Buffer</code> from a match context to a sub binary (or do nothing if <code class="code">Buffer</code> is a binary already).</p> <p>But in more complicated code, how can one know whether the optimization is applied or not?</p> <h4> <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('ghlink-option-bin_opt_info-idm388').style.visibility = 'visible';" onmouseout="document.getElementById('ghlink-option-bin_opt_info-idm388').style.visibility = 'hidden';" id="bin_opt_info">Option bin_opt_info</span> </h4> <p>Use the <code class="code">bin_opt_info</code> option to have the compiler print a lot of information about binary optimizations.
