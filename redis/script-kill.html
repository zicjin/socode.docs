<pre>SCRIPT KILL</pre>   <div class="metadata"> <p><strong>Available since 2.6.0.</strong></p> <p><strong>Time complexity:</strong> O(1)</p> </div> <p>Kills the currently executing Lua script, assuming no write operation was yet performed by the script.</p> <p>This command is mainly useful to kill a script that is running for too much time(for instance because it entered an infinite loop because of a bug). The script will be killed and the client currently blocked into EVAL will see the command returning with an error.</p> <p>If the script already performed write operations it can not be killed in this way because it would violate Lua script atomicity contract. In such a case only <code>SHUTDOWN NOSAVE</code> is able to kill the script, killing the Redis process in an hard way preventing it to persist with half-written information.</p> <p>Please refer to the <a href="eval">EVAL</a> documentation for detailed information about Redis Lua scripting.</p> <h2>Return value</h2> <p><a href="https://redis.io/topics/protocol#simple-string-reply">Simple string reply</a></p>  <div class="_attribution">
