<h1 class="command">SELECT</h1>
<pre>SELECT index</pre>   <div class="metadata"> <p><strong>Available since 1.0.0.</strong></p> <p><strong>Time complexity:</strong> O(1)</p> </div> <p>Select the Redis logical database having the specified zero-based numeric index. New connections always use the database 0.</p> <p>Selectable Redis databases are a form of namespacing: all databases are still persisted in the same RDB / AOF file. However different databases can have keys with the same name, and commands like <a href="flushdb">FLUSHDB</a>, <a href="swapdb">SWAPDB</a> or <a href="randomkey">RANDOMKEY</a> work on specific databases.</p> <p>In practical terms, Redis databases should be used to separate different keys belonging to the same application (if needed), and not to use a single Redis instance for multiple unrelated applications.</p> <p>When using Redis Cluster, the <a href="select">SELECT</a> command cannot be used, since Redis Cluster only supports database zero. In the case of a Redis Cluster, having multiple databases would be useless and an unnecessary source of complexity. Commands operating atomically on a single database would not be possible with the Redis Cluster design and goals.</p> <p>Since the currently selected database is a property of the connection, clients should track the currently selected database and re-select it on reconnection. While there is no command in order to query the selected database in the current connection, the <a href="client-list">CLIENT LIST</a> output shows, for each client, the currently selected database.</p> <h2>Return value</h2> <p><a href="https://redis.io/topics/protocol#simple-string-reply">Simple string reply</a></p>  <div class="_attribution">
