<pre>CLUSTER COUNT-FAILURE-REPORTS node-id</pre>   <div class="metadata"> <p><strong>Available since 3.0.0.</strong></p> <p><strong>Time complexity:</strong> O(N) where N is the number of failure reports</p> </div> <p>The command returns the number of <em>failure reports</em> for the specified node. Failure reports are the way Redis Cluster uses in order to promote a <code>PFAIL</code> state, that means a node is not reachable, to a <code>FAIL</code> state, that means that the majority of masters in the cluster agreed within a window of time that the node is not reachable.</p> <p>A few more details:</p> <ul> <li>A node flags another node with <code>PFAIL</code> when the node is not reachable for a time greater than the configured <em>node timeout</em>, which is a fundamental configuration parameter of a Redis Cluster.</li> <li>Nodes in <code>PFAIL</code> state are provided in gossip sections of heartbeat packets.</li> <li>Every time a node processes gossip packets from other nodes, it creates (and refreshes the TTL if needed) <strong>failure reports</strong>, remembering that a given node said another given node is in <code>PFAIL</code> condition.</li> <li>Each failure report has a time to live of two times the <em>node timeout</em> time.</li> <li>If at a given time a node has another node flagged with <code>PFAIL</code>, and at the same time collected the majority of other master nodes <em>failure reports</em> about this node (including itself if it is a master), then it elevates the failure state of the node from <code>PFAIL</code> to <code>FAIL</code>, and broadcasts a message forcing all the nodes that can be reached to flag the node as <code>FAIL</code>.</li> </ul> <p>This command returns the number of failure reports for the current node which are currently not expired (so received within two times the <em>node timeout</em> time). The count does not include what the node we are asking this count believes about the node ID we pass as argument, the count <em>only</em> includes the failure reports the node received from other nodes.</p> <p>This command is mainly useful for debugging, when the failure detector of Redis Cluster is not operating as we believe it should.</p> <h2>Return value</h2> <p><a href="https://redis.io/topics/protocol#integer-reply">Integer reply</a>: the number of active failure reports for the node.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
