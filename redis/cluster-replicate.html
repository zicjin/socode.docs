<pre>CLUSTER REPLICATE node-id</pre>   <div class="metadata"> <p><strong>Available since 3.0.0.</strong></p> <p><strong>Time complexity:</strong> O(1)</p> </div> <p>The command reconfigures a node as a replica of the specified master. If the node receiving the command is an <em>empty master</em>, as a side effect of the command, the node role is changed from master to replica.</p> <p>Once a node is turned into the replica of another master node, there is no need to inform the other cluster nodes about the change: heartbeat packets exchanged between nodes will propagate the new configuration automatically.</p> <p>A replica will always accept the command, assuming that:</p> <ol> <li>The specified node ID exists in its nodes table.</li> <li>The specified node ID does not identify the instance we are sending the command to.</li> <li>The specified node ID is a master.</li> </ol> <p>If the node receiving the command is not already a replica, but is a master, the command will only succeed, and the node will be converted into a replica, only if the following additional conditions are met:</p> <ol> <li>The node is not serving any hash slots.</li> <li>The node is empty, no keys are stored at all in the key space.</li> </ol> <p>If the command succeeds the new replica will immediately try to contact its master in order to replicate from it.</p> <h2>Return value</h2> <p><a href="https://redis.io/topics/protocol#simple-string-reply">Simple string reply</a>: <code>OK</code> if the command was executed successfully, otherwise an error is returned.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
