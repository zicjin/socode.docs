<h1 class="command">SORT</h1>
<pre>SORT key [BY pattern] [LIMIT offset count] [GET pattern [GET pattern ...]] [ASC|DESC] [ALPHA] [STORE destination]</pre>   <div class="metadata"> <p><strong>Available since 1.0.0.</strong></p> <p><strong>Time complexity:</strong> O(N+M*log(M)) where N is the number of elements in the list or set to sort, and M the number of returned elements. When the elements are not sorted, complexity is currently O(N) as there is a copy step that will be avoided in next releases.</p> </div> <p>Returns or stores the elements contained in the <a href="https://redis.io/topics/data-types#lists">list</a>, <a href="https://redis.io/topics/data-types#set">set</a> or <a href="https://redis.io/topics/data-types#sorted-sets">sorted set</a> at <code>key</code>. By default, sorting is numeric and elements are compared by their value interpreted as double precision floating point number. This is <a href="sort">SORT</a> in its simplest form:</p> <pre>SORT mylist
</pre> <p>Assuming <code>mylist</code> is a list of numbers, this command will return the same list with the elements sorted from small to large. In order to sort the numbers from large to small, use the <code>DESC</code> modifier:</p> <pre>SORT mylist DESC
</pre> <p>When <code>mylist</code> contains string values and you want to sort them lexicographically, use the <code>ALPHA</code> modifier:</p> <pre>SORT mylist ALPHA
</pre> <p>Redis is UTF-8 aware, assuming you correctly set the <code>!LC_COLLATE</code> environment variable.</p> <p>The number of returned elements can be limited using the <code>LIMIT</code> modifier. This modifier takes the <code>offset</code> argument, specifying the number of elements to skip and the <code>count</code> argument, specifying the number of elements to return from starting at <code>offset</code>. The following example will return 10 elements of the sorted version of <code>mylist</code>, starting at element 0 (<code>offset</code> is zero-based):</p> <pre>SORT mylist LIMIT 0 10
</pre> <p>Almost all modifiers can be used together. The following example will return the first 5 elements, lexicographically sorted in descending order:</p> <pre>SORT mylist LIMIT 0 5 ALPHA DESC
</pre> <h2>Sorting by external keys</h2> <p>Sometimes you want to sort elements using external keys as weights to compare instead of comparing the actual elements in the list, set or sorted set. Let's say the list <code>mylist</code> contains the elements <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> representing unique IDs of objects stored in <code>object_1</code>, <code>object_2</code> and <code>object_3</code>. When these objects have associated weights stored in <code>weight_1</code>, <code>weight_2</code> and <code>weight_3</code>, <a href="sort">SORT</a> can be instructed to use these weights to sort <code>mylist</code> with the following statement:</p> <pre>SORT mylist BY weight_*
</pre> <p>The <code>BY</code> option takes a pattern (equal to <code>weight_*</code> in this example) that is used to generate the keys that are used for sorting. These key names are obtained substituting the first occurrence of <code>*</code> with the actual value of the element in the list (<code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> in this example).</p> <h2>Skip sorting the elements</h2> <p>The <code>BY</code> option can also take a non-existent key, which causes <a href="sort">SORT</a> to skip the sorting operation. This is useful if you want to retrieve external keys (see the <code>GET</code> option below) without the overhead of sorting.</p> <pre>SORT mylist BY nosort
</pre> <h2>Retrieving external keys</h2> <p>Our previous example returns just the sorted IDs. In some cases, it is more useful to get the actual objects instead of their IDs (<code>object_1</code>, <code>object_2</code> and <code>object_3</code>). Retrieving external keys based on the elements in a list, set or sorted set can be done with the following command:</p> <pre>SORT mylist BY weight_* GET object_*
</pre> <p>The <code>GET</code> option can be used multiple times in order to get more keys for every element of the original list, set or sorted set.</p> <p>It is also possible to <code>GET</code> the element itself using the special pattern <code>#</code>:</p> <pre>SORT mylist BY weight_* GET object_* GET #
</pre> <h2>Storing the result of a SORT operation</h2> <p>By default, <a href="sort">SORT</a> returns the sorted elements to the client. With the <code>STORE</code> option, the result will be stored as a list at the specified key instead of being returned to the client.</p> <pre>SORT mylist BY weight_* STORE resultkey
</pre> <p>An interesting pattern using <code>SORT ... STORE</code> consists in associating an <a href="expire">EXPIRE</a> timeout to the resulting key so that in applications where the result of a <a href="sort">SORT</a> operation can be cached for some time. Other clients will use the cached list instead of calling <a href="sort">SORT</a> for every request. When the key will timeout, an updated version of the cache can be created by calling <code>SORT ... STORE</code> again.</p> <p>Note that for correctly implementing this pattern it is important to avoid multiple clients rebuilding the cache at the same time. Some kind of locking is needed here (for instance using <a href="setnx">SETNX</a>).</p> <h2>Using hashes in <code>BY</code> and <code>GET</code>
</h2> <p>It is possible to use <code>BY</code> and <code>GET</code> options against hash fields with the following syntax:</p> <pre>SORT mylist BY weight_*-&gt;fieldname GET object_*-&gt;fieldname
</pre> <p>The string <code>-&gt;</code> is used to separate the key name from the hash field name. The key is substituted as documented above, and the hash stored at the resulting key is accessed to retrieve the specified hash field.</p> <h2>Return value</h2> <p><a href="https://redis.io/topics/protocol#array-reply">Array reply</a>: without passing the <code>store</code> option the command returns a list of sorted elements. <a href="https://redis.io/topics/protocol#integer-reply">Integer reply</a>: when the <code>store</code> option is specified the command returns the number of sorted elements in the destination list.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
