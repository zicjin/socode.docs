<h1 class="command">CLIENT</h1>
<pre>CLIENT REPLY ON|OFF|SKIP</pre>   <div class="metadata"> <p><strong>Available since 3.2.0.</strong></p> <p><strong>Time complexity:</strong> O(1)</p> </div> <p>Sometimes it can be useful for clients to completely disable replies from the Redis server. For example when the client sends fire and forget commands or performs a mass loading of data, or in caching contexts where new data is streamed constantly. In such contexts to use server time and bandwidth in order to send back replies to clients, which are going to be ignored, is considered wasteful.</p> <p>The <a href="client-reply">CLIENT REPLY</a> command controls whether the server will reply the client's commands. The following modes are available:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>ON</code>. This is the default mode in which the server returns a reply to every command.</li> <li>
<code>OFF</code>. In this mode the server will not reply to client commands.</li> <li>
<code>SKIP</code>. This mode skips the reply of command immediately after it.</li> </ul> <h2>Return value</h2> <p>When called with either <code>OFF</code> or <code>SKIP</code> subcommands, no reply is made. When called with <code>ON</code>:</p> <p><a href="https://redis.io/topics/protocol#simple-string-reply">Simple string reply</a>: <code>OK</code>.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
