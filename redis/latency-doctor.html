Dave, I have observed latency spikes in this Redis instance.
You don't mind talking about it, do you Dave?

1. command: 5 latency spikes (average 300ms, mean deviation 120ms,
    period 73.40 sec). Worst all time event 500ms.

I have a few advices for you:

- Your current Slow Log configuration only logs events that are
    slower than your configured latency monitor threshold. Please
    use 'CONFIG SET slowlog-log-slower-than 1000'.
- Check your Slow Log to understand what are the commands you are
    running which are too slow to execute. Please check
    http://redis.io/commands/slowlog for more information.
- Deleting, expiring or evicting (because of maxmemory policy)
    large objects is a blocking operation. If you have very large
    objects that are often deleted, expired, or evicted, try to
    fragment those objects into multiple smaller objects.
