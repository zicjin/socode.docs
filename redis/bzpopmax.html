<pre>BZPOPMAX key [key ...] timeout</pre>   <div class="metadata"> <p><strong>Available since 5.0.0.</strong></p> <p><strong>Time complexity:</strong> O(log(N)) with N being the number of elements in the sorted set.</p> </div> <p><a href="bzpopmax">BZPOPMAX</a> is the blocking variant of the sorted set <a href="zpopmax">ZPOPMAX</a> primitive.</p> <p>It is the blocking version because it blocks the connection when there are no members to pop from any of the given sorted sets. A member with the highest score is popped from first sorted set that is non-empty, with the given keys being checked in the order that they are given.</p> <p>The <code>timeout</code> argument is interpreted as a double value specifying the maximum number of seconds to block. A timeout of zero can be used to block indefinitely.</p> <p>See the <a href="bzpopmin">BZPOPMIN documentation</a> for the exact semantics, since <a href="bzpopmax">BZPOPMAX</a> is identical to <a href="bzpopmin">BZPOPMIN</a> with the only difference being that it pops members with the highest scores instead of popping the ones with the lowest scores.</p> <h2>Return value</h2> <p><a href="https://redis.io/topics/protocol#array-reply">Array reply</a>: specifically:</p> <ul> <li>A <code>nil</code> multi-bulk when no element could be popped and the timeout expired.</li> <li>A three-element multi-bulk with the first element being the name of the key where a member was popped, the second element is the popped member itself, and the third element is the score of the popped element.</li> </ul> <h2>Examples</h2> <pre>redis&gt; DEL zset1 zset2
(integer) 0
redis&gt; ZADD zset1 0 a 1 b 2 c
(integer) 3
redis&gt; BZPOPMAX zset1 zset2 0
1) "zset1"
2) "c"
3) "2"
</pre> <h2>History</h2> <ul> <li> Redis version &gt;= 6.0.0: `timeout` is interpreted as a double instead of an integer. </li> </ul>  <div class="_attribution">
