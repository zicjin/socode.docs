<h1 class="command">CLIENT</h1>
<pre>CLIENT ID</pre>   <div class="metadata"> <p><strong>Available since 5.0.0.</strong></p> <p><strong>Time complexity:</strong> O(1)</p> </div> <p>The command just returns the ID of the current connection. Every connection ID has certain guarantees:</p> <ol> <li>It is never repeated, so if <a href="client-id">CLIENT ID</a> returns the same number, the caller can be sure that the underlying client did not disconnect and reconnect the connection, but it is still the same connection.</li> <li>The ID is monotonically incremental. If the ID of a connection is greater than the ID of another connection, it is guaranteed that the second connection was established with the server at a later time.</li> </ol> <p>This command is especially useful together with <a href="client-unblock">CLIENT UNBLOCK</a> which was introduced also in Redis 5 together with <a href="client-id">CLIENT ID</a>. Check the <a href="client-unblock">CLIENT UNBLOCK</a> command page for a pattern involving the two commands.</p> <h2>Examples</h2> <div class="example" data-session="95c90acd18c79db61199d5900655d19b"> <span class="monospace prompt">redis&gt; </span> <span class="monospace command">CLIENT ID</span> <code>ERR Unknown or disabled command 'CLIENT'</code>
