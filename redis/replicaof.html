In the proper form <a href="replicaof">REPLICAOF</a> hostname port will make the server a replica of another server listening at the specified hostname and port.</p> <p>If a server is already a replica of some master, <a href="replicaof">REPLICAOF</a> hostname port will stop the replication against the old server and start the synchronization against the new one, discarding the old dataset.</p> <p>The form <a href="replicaof">REPLICAOF</a> NO ONE will stop replication, turning the server into a MASTER, but will not discard the replication. So, if the old master stops working, it is possible to turn the replica into a master and set the application to use this new master in read/write. Later when the other Redis server is fixed, it can be reconfigured to work as a replica.</p> <h2>Return value</h2> <p><a href="https://redis.io/topics/protocol#simple-string-reply">Simple string reply</a></p> <h2>Examples</h2> <pre>&gt; REPLICAOF NO ONE
