<h1 class="command">BGREWRITEAOF</h1>
<pre>BGREWRITEAOF</pre>   <div class="metadata"> <p><strong>Available since 1.0.0.</strong></p> </div> <p>Instruct Redis to start an <a href="https://redis.io/topics/persistence#append-only-file">Append Only File</a> rewrite process. The rewrite will create a small optimized version of the current Append Only File.</p> <p>If <a href="bgrewriteaof">BGREWRITEAOF</a> fails, no data gets lost as the old AOF will be untouched.</p> <p>The rewrite will be only triggered by Redis if there is not already a background process doing persistence.</p> <p>Specifically:</p> <ul> <li>If a Redis child is creating a snapshot on disk, the AOF rewrite is <em>scheduled</em> but not started until the saving child producing the RDB file terminates. In this case the <a href="bgrewriteaof">BGREWRITEAOF</a> will still return an positive status reply, but with an appropriate message. You can check if an AOF rewrite is scheduled looking at the <a href="info">INFO</a> command as of Redis 2.6 or successive versions.</li> <li>If an AOF rewrite is already in progress the command returns an error and no AOF rewrite will be scheduled for a later time.</li> <li>If the AOF rewrite could start, but the attempt at starting it fails (for instance because of an error in creating the child process), an error is returned to the caller.</li> </ul> <p>Since Redis 2.4 the AOF rewrite is automatically triggered by Redis, however the <a href="bgrewriteaof">BGREWRITEAOF</a> command can be used to trigger a rewrite at any time.</p> <p>Please refer to the <a href="https://redis.io/topics/persistence">persistence documentation</a> for detailed information.</p> <h2>Return value</h2> <p><a href="https://redis.io/topics/protocol#simple-string-reply">Simple string reply</a>: A simple string reply indicating that the rewriting started or is about to start ASAP, when the call is executed with success.</p> <p>The command may reply with an error in certain cases, as documented above.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
