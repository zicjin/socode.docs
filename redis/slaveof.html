<pre>SLAVEOF host port</pre>   <div class="metadata"> <p><strong>Available since 1.0.0.</strong></p> <p><strong>Time complexity:</strong> O(1)</p> </div> <p><strong>A note about the word slave used in this man page and command name</strong>: starting with Redis version 5, if not for backward compatibility, the Redis project no longer uses the word slave. Please use the new command <a href="replicaof">REPLICAOF</a>. The command <a href="slaveof">SLAVEOF</a> will continue to work for backward compatibility.</p> <p>The <a href="slaveof">SLAVEOF</a> command can change the replication settings of a replica on the fly. If a Redis server is already acting as replica, the command <a href="slaveof">SLAVEOF</a> NO ONE will turn off the replication, turning the Redis server into a MASTER. In the proper form <a href="slaveof">SLAVEOF</a> hostname port will make the server a replica of another server listening at the specified hostname and port.</p> <p>If a server is already a replica of some master, <a href="slaveof">SLAVEOF</a> hostname port will stop the replication against the old server and start the synchronization against the new one, discarding the old dataset.</p> <p>The form <a href="slaveof">SLAVEOF</a> NO ONE will stop replication, turning the server into a MASTER, but will not discard the replication. So, if the old master stops working, it is possible to turn the replica into a master and set the application to use this new master in read/write. Later when the other Redis server is fixed, it can be reconfigured to work as a replica.</p> <h2>Return value</h2> <p><a href="https://redis.io/topics/protocol#simple-string-reply">Simple string reply</a></p>  <div class="_attribution">
