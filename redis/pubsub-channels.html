<pre>PUBSUB CHANNELS [pattern]</pre>   <div class="metadata"> <p><strong>Available since 2.8.0.</strong></p> <p><strong>Time complexity:</strong> O(N) where N is the number of active channels, and assuming constant time pattern matching (relatively short channels and patterns)</p> </div> <p>Lists the currently <em>active channels</em>.</p> <p>An active channel is a Pub/Sub channel with one or more subscribers (excluding clients subscribed to patterns).</p> <p>If no <code>pattern</code> is specified, all the channels are listed, otherwise if pattern is specified only channels matching the specified glob-style pattern are listed.</p> <p>Cluster note: in a Redis Cluster clients can subscribe to every node, and can also publish to every other node. The cluster will make sure that published messages are forwarded as needed. That said, <a href="pubsub">PUBSUB</a>'s replies in a cluster only report information from the node's Pub/Sub context, rather than the entire cluster.</p> <h2>Return value</h2> <p><a href="https://redis.io/topics/protocol#array-reply">Array reply</a>: a list of active channels, optionally matching the specified pattern.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
