<pre>CLUSTER SLAVES node-id</pre>   <div class="metadata"> <p><strong>Available since 3.0.0.</strong></p> <p><strong>Time complexity:</strong> O(1)</p> </div> <p><strong>A note about the word slave used in this man page and command name</strong>: Starting with Redis 5 this command: starting with Redis version 5, if not for backward compatibility, the Redis project no longer uses the word slave. Please use the new command <a href="cluster-replicas">CLUSTER REPLICAS</a>. The command <a href="slaveof">SLAVEOF</a> will continue to work for backward compatibility.</p> <p>The command provides a list of replica nodes replicating from the specified master node. The list is provided in the same format used by <a href="cluster-nodes">CLUSTER NODES</a> (please refer to its documentation for the specification of the format).</p> <p>The command will fail if the specified node is not known or if it is not a master according to the node table of the node receiving the command.</p> <p>Note that if a replica is added, moved, or removed from a given master node, and we ask <a href="cluster-slaves">CLUSTER SLAVES</a> to a node that has not yet received the configuration update, it may show stale information. However eventually (in a matter of seconds if there are no network partitions) all the nodes will agree about the set of nodes associated with a given master.</p> <h2>Return value</h2> <p>The command returns data in the same format as <a href="cluster-nodes">CLUSTER NODES</a>.</p>  <div class="_attribution">
