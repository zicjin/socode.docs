This may happen because:</p> <ol> <li>The client sent a command about hash slots never served by the master of this replica.</li> <li>The cluster was reconfigured (for example resharded) and the replica is no longer able to serve commands for a given hash slot.</li> </ol> <h2>Return value</h2> <p><a href="https://redis.io/topics/protocol#simple-string-reply">Simple string reply</a></p>  <div class="_attribution">
