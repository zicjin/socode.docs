<pre>COMMAND</pre>   <div class="metadata"> <p><strong>Available since 2.8.13.</strong></p> <p><strong>Time complexity:</strong> O(N) where N is the total number of Redis commands</p> </div> <p>Return an array with details about every Redis command.</p> <p>The <a href="command">COMMAND</a> command is introspective. Its reply describes all commands that the server can process. Redis clients can call it to obtain the server's runtime capabilities during the handshake.</p> <p><a href="command">COMMAND</a> also has several subcommands. Please refer to its subcommands for further details.</p> <p><strong>Cluster note:</strong> this command is especially beneficial for cluster-aware clients. Such clients must identify the names of keys in commands to route requests to the correct shard. Although most commands accept a single key as their first argument, there are many exceptions to this rule. You can call <a href="command">COMMAND</a> and then keep the mapping between commands and their respective key specification rules cached in the client.</p> <p>The reply it returns is an array with an element per command. Each element that describes a Redis command is represented as an array by itself.</p> <p>The command's array consists of a fixed number of elements. The exact number of elements in the array depends on the server's version.</p> <ol> <li>Name</li> <li>Arity</li> <li>Flags</li> <li>First key</li> <li>Last key</li> <li>Step</li> <li>

It follows a simple pattern:</p> <ul> <li>A positive integer means a fixed number of arguments.</li> <li>A negative integer means a minimal number of arguments.</li> </ul> <p>Command arity <em>always includes</em> the command's name itself (and the subcommand when applicable).</p> <p>Examples:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="get">GET</a>'s arity is <em>2</em> since the command only accepts one argument and always has the format <code>GET _key_</code>.</li> <li>
<a href="mget">MGET</a>'s arity is <em>-2</em> since the command accepts at least one argument, but possibly multiple ones: <code>MGET _key1_ [key2] [key3] ...</code>.</li> </ul> <h2>Flags</h2> <p>Command flags are an array. It can contain the following simple strings (status reply):</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>admin:</strong> the command is an administrative command.</li> <li>
<strong>asking:</strong> the command is allowed even during hash slot migration. This flag is relevant in Redis Cluster deployments.</li> <li>
<strong>blocking:</strong> the command may block the requesting client.</li> <li>
<strong>denyoom</strong>: the command is rejected if the server's memory usage is too high (see the <em>maxmemory</em> configuration directive).</li> <li>
<strong>fast:</strong> the command operates in constant or log(N) time. This flag is used for monitoring latency with the <a href="latency">LATENCY</a> command.</li> <li>
<strong>loading:</strong> the command is allowed while the database is loading.</li> <li>
<strong>may_replicate:</strong> the command may be replicated to replicas and the AOF.</li> <li>
<strong>movablekeys:</strong> the <em>first key</em>, <em>last key</em>, and <em>step</em> values don't determine all key positions. Clients need to use <a href="command-getkeys">COMMAND GETKEYS</a> or <a href="https://redis.io/topics/key-specs">key specifications</a> in this case. See below for more details.</li> <li>
<strong>no_auth:</strong> executing the command doesn't require authentication.</li> <li>
<strong>no<em>async</em>loading:</strong> the command is denied during asynchronous loading (that is when a replica uses disk-less <code>SWAPDB SYNC</code>, and allows access to the old dataset).</li> <li>
<strong>no<em>mandatory</em>keys:</strong> the command may accept key name arguments, but these aren't mandatory.</li> <li>
<strong>no_multi:</strong> the command isn't allowed inside the context of a <a href="https://redis.io/topics/transactions">transaction</a>.</li> <li>
<strong>noscript:</strong> the command can't be called from <a href="https://redis.io/topics/eval-intro">scripts</a> or <a href="https://redis.io/topics/functions-intro">functions</a>.</li> <li>
<strong>pubsub:</strong> the command is related to <a href="https://redis.io/topics/pubsub">Redis Pub/Sub</a>.</li> <li>
<strong>random</strong>: the command returns random results, which is a concern with verbatim script replication. As of Redis 7.0, this flag is a <a href="https://redis.io/topics/command-tips">command tip</a>.</li> <li>
<strong>readonly:</strong> the command doesn't modify data.</li> <li>
<strong>sort<em>for</em>script:</strong> the command's output is sorted when called from a script.</li> <li>
<strong>skip_monitor:</strong> the command is not shown in <a href="monitor">MONITOR</a>'s output.</li> <li>
<strong>skip_slowlog:</strong> the command is not shown in <a href="slowlog">SLOWLOG</a>'s output. As of Redis 7.0, this flag is a <a href="https://redis.io/topics/command-tips">command tip</a>.</li> <li>
<strong>stale:</strong> the command is allowed while a replica has stale data.</li> <li>
<strong>write:</strong> the command may modify data.</li> </ul> <h3>Movablekeys</h3> <p>Consider <a href="sort">SORT</a>:</p> <pre>1) 1) "sort"

</pre> <p>Some Redis commands have no predetermined key locations or are not easy to find. For those commands, the <em>movablekeys</em> flag indicates that the <em>first key</em>, <em>last key</em>, and <em>step</em> values are insufficient to find all the keys.</p> <p>Here are several examples of commands that have the <em>movablekeys</em> flag:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="sort">SORT</a>: the optional <em>STORE</em>, <em>BY</em>, and <em>GET</em> modifiers are followed by names of keys.</li> <li>
<a href="zunion">ZUNION</a>: the <em>numkeys</em> argument specifies the number key name arguments.</li> <li>
<a href="migrate">MIGRATE</a>: the keys appear <em>KEYS</em> keyword and only when the second argument is the empty string.</li> </ul> <p>Redis Cluster clients need to use other measures, as follows, to locate the keys for such commands.</p> <p>You can use the <a href="command-getkeys">COMMAND GETKEYS</a> command and have your Redis server report all keys of a given command's invocation.</p> <p>As of Redis 7.0, clients can use the <a href="#key-specifications">key specifications</a> to identify the positions of key names. The only commands that require using <a href="command-getkeys">COMMAND GETKEYS</a> are <a href="sort">SORT</a> and <a href="migrate">MIGRATE</a> for clients that parse keys' specifications.</p> <p>For more information, please refer to the <a href="https://redis.io/topics/key-specs">key specifications page</a>.</p> <h2>First key</h2> <p>This value identifies the position of the command's first key name argument. For most commands, the first key's position is 1. Position 0 is always the command name itself.</p> <h2>Last key</h2> <p>This value identifies the position of the command's last key name argument. Redis commands usually accept one, two or multiple number of keys.</p> <p>Commands that accept a single key have both <em>first key</em> and <em>last key</em> set to 1.</p> <p>Commands that accept two key name arguments, e.g. <a href="brpoplpush">BRPOPLPUSH</a>, <a href="smove">SMOVE</a> and <a href="rename">RENAME</a>, have this value set to the position of their second key.</p> <p>Multi-key commands that accept an arbitrary number of keys, such as <a href="mset">MSET</a>, use the value -1.</p> <h2>Step</h2> <p>This value is the step, or increment, between the <em>first key</em> and <em>last key</em> values where the keys are.</p> <p>Consider the following two examples:</p> <pre>1) 1) "mset"
   2) (integer) -3
   3) 1) write
      2) denyoom
   4) (integer) 1
   5) (integer) -1
   6) (integer) 2

</pre> <p>The step count allows us to find keys' positions for commands like <a href="mset">MSET</a>. Its syntax is <code>MSET _key1_ _val1_ [key2] [val2] [key3] [val3]...</code>, and the keys are at every other position. Therefore, unlike <a href="mget">MGET</a>, which uses a step value of <em>1</em>, <a href="mset">MSET</a> uses <em>2</em>.</p> <h2>ACL categories</h2> <p>This is an array of simple strings that are the ACL categories to which the command belongs.
