 <h1 id="provider-registry-protocol">  Provider Registry Protocol </h1> <blockquote class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <p>Third-party provider registries are supported only in Terraform CLI 0.13 and later. Prior versions do not support this protocol.</p> </blockquote> <p>The provider registry protocol is what Terraform CLI uses to discover metadata about providers available for installation and to locate the distribution packages for a selected provider.</p> <p>The primary implementation of this protocol is the public <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/">Terraform Registry</a> at <code>registry.terraform.io</code>. By writing and deploying your own implementation of this protocol, you can create a separate <em>origin registry</em> to distribute your own providers, as an alternative to publishing them on the public Terraform Registry.</p> <p>This page describes the provider <em>registry</em> protocol, which is the protocol for finding providers available for installation. It <em>doesn't</em> describe the API that provider plugins themselves implement to serve requests from Terraform CLI at runtime. For more information on the provider API, see the Terraform SDK documentation.</p> <p>The public Terraform Registry implements a superset of the API described on this page, in order to capture additional information used in the registry UI. Third-party implementations should not include those extensions because they may change in future without notice.</p> <h2 id="provider-addresses">  Provider Addresses </h2> <p>Each Terraform provider has an associated address which uniquely identifies it within Terraform. A provider address has the syntax <code>hostname/namespace/type</code>, where:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="#hostname"><code>hostname</code></a> is the registry host that the provider is considered to have originated from, and the default location Terraform will consult for information about the provider <a href="../cli/config/config-file#provider-installation">unless overridden in the CLI configuration</a>. </li> <li>
<a href="#namespace"><code>namespace</code></a> is the name of a namespace, unique on a particular hostname, that can contain one or more providers that are somehow related. On the public Terraform Registry the "namespace" represents the organization that is packaging and distributing the provider. </li> <li>
<a href="#type"><code>type</code></a> is the provider type, like "azurerm", "aws", "google", "dns", etc. A provider type is unique within a particular hostname and namespace. </li> </ul> <p>The <code>hostname/</code> portion of a provider address (including its slash delimiter) is optional, and if omitted defaults to <code>registry.terraform.io/</code>.</p> <p>For example:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="#hashicorp-aws"><code>hashicorp/aws</code></a> is a shorthand for <code>registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws</code>, which is the official AWS provider published by HashiCorp. </li> <li>
<a href="#example-foo"><code>example/foo</code></a> is a shorthand for <code>registry.terraform.io/example/foo</code>, which is a hypothetical third-party provider published on the public Terraform Registry. </li> <li>
<a href="#example-com-bar-baz"><code>example.com/bar/baz</code></a> is a hypothetical third-party provider published at a third-party provider registry on <code>example.com</code>. </li> </ul> <p>If you intend only to share a provider you've developed for use by all Terraform users, please consider publishing it into the public <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/">Terraform Registry</a>, which will make your provider discoverable. You only need to implement this provider registry protocol if you wish to publish providers whose addresses include a different hostname that is under your control.</p> <p>Terraform uses the full address (after normalization to always include a hostname) as its global identifier for providers internally, and so it's important to note that re-uploading the <code>hashicorp/azurerm</code> provider into another namespace or publishing it on a different hostname will cause Terraform to see it as an entirely separate provider that will <em>not</em> be usable by modules that declare a dependency on <code>hashicorp/azurerm</code>. If your goal is to create an alternative local distribution source for an existing provider -- that is, a <em>mirror</em> of the provider -- refer to <a href="../cli/config/config-file#provider-installation">the provider installation method configuration</a> instead.</p> <h2 id="provider-versions">  Provider Versions </h2> <p>Each distinct provider address has associated with it a set of versions, each of which has an associated version number. Terraform assumes version numbers follow the <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning 2.0</a> conventions, with the schema and behavior of the provider as documented from the perspective of an end-user of Terraform serving as the "public API".</p> <p>All available versions for a particular provider address are considered to be the same provider by Terraform. Each Terraform configuration selects only one version of each provider for use in the entire configuration, so the version constraints across all modules are considered together for the purposes of version selection.</p> <h2 id="service-discovery">  Service Discovery </h2> <p>The providers protocol begins with Terraform CLI using <a href="remote-service-discovery">Terraform's remote service discovery protocol</a>, with the hostname in the provider address acting as the "User-facing Hostname".</p> <p>The service identifier for the provider registry protocol is <code>providers.v1</code>. Its associated string value is the base URL for the relative URLs defined in the sections that follow.</p> <p>For example, the service discovery document for a host that <em>only</em> implements the provider registry protocol might contain the following:</p> <pre data-language="json">{
  "providers.v1": "/terraform/providers/v1/"
}
</pre>
<p>If the given URL is a relative URL then Terraform will interpret it as relative to the discovery document itself. The specific provider registry protocol endpoints are defined as URLs relative to the given base URL, and so the specified base URL should generally end with a slash to ensure that those relative paths will be resolved as expected.</p> <p>The following sections describe the various operations that a provider registry must implement to be compatible with Terraform CLI's provider installer. The indicated URLs are all relative to the URL resulting from service discovery, as described above. We use the current URLs on Terraform Registry as working examples, assuming that the caller already performed service discovery on <code>registry.terraform.io</code> to learn the base URL.</p> <p>The URLs are shown with the convention that a path portion with a colon <code>:</code> prefix is a placeholder for a dynamically-selected value, while all other path portions are literal. For example, in <code>:namespace/:type/versions</code>, the first two path portions are placeholders while the third is literally the string "versions".</p> <h2 id="list-available-versions">  List Available Versions </h2> <p>This operation determines which versions are currently available for a particular provider.</p> <table>
