 <h1 id="debugging-terraform">  Debugging Terraform </h1> <blockquote> <p><strong>Hands-on:</strong> Try the <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/troubleshooting-workflow?utm_source=WEBSITE&amp;utm_medium=WEB_IO&amp;utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&amp;utm_content=DOCS">Troubleshooting Workflow</a> tutorial on HashiCorp Learn.</p> </blockquote> <p>Terraform has detailed logs which can be enabled by setting the <code>TF_LOG</code> environment variable to any value. This will cause detailed logs to appear on stderr.</p> <p>You can set <code>TF_LOG</code> to one of the log levels <code>TRACE</code>, <code>DEBUG</code>, <code>INFO</code>, <code>WARN</code> or <code>ERROR</code> to change the verbosity of the logs.</p> <p>Setting <code>TF_LOG</code> to <code>JSON</code> outputs logs at the <code>TRACE</code> level or higher, and uses a parseable JSON encoding as the formatting.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <p><strong>Warning:</strong> The JSON encoding of log files is not considered a stable interface. It may change at any time, without warning. It is meant to support tooling that will be forthcoming, and that tooling is the only supported way to interact with JSON formatted logs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Logging can be enabled separately for terraform itself and the provider plugins using the <code>TF_LOG_CORE</code> or <code>TF_LOG_PROVIDER</code> environment variables. These take the same level arguments as <code>TF_LOG</code>, but only activate a subset of the logs.</p> <p>To persist logged output you can set <code>TF_LOG_PATH</code> in order to force the log to always be appended to a specific file when logging is enabled. Note that even when <code>TF_LOG_PATH</code> is set, <code>TF_LOG</code> must be set in order for any logging to be enabled.</p> <p>If you find a bug with Terraform, please include the detailed log by using a service such as gist.</p> <h2 id="interpreting-a-crash-log">  Interpreting a Crash Log </h2> <p>If Terraform ever crashes (a "panic" in the Go runtime), it saves a log file with the debug logs from the session as well as the panic message and backtrace to <code>crash.log</code>. Generally speaking, this log file is meant to be passed along to the developers via a GitHub Issue. As a user, you're not required to dig into this file.</p> <p>However, if you are interested in figuring out what might have gone wrong before filing an issue, here are the basic details of how to read a crash log.</p> <p>The most interesting part of a crash log is the panic message itself and the backtrace immediately following. So the first thing to do is to search the file for <code>panic:</code>, which should jump you right to this message. It will look something like this:</p> <pre>panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference

<p>The key part of this message is the first two lines that involve <code>hashicorp/terraform</code>. In this example:</p> <pre>github.com/hashicorp/terraform/builtin/providers/aws.resourceAwsSomeResourceCreate(...)
    /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform/builtin/providers/aws/resource_aws_some_resource.go:123 +0x123
</pre>
<p>The first line tells us that the method that failed is <code>resourceAwsSomeResourceCreate</code>, which we can deduce that involves the creation of a (fictional) <code>aws_some_resource</code>.</p> <p>The second line points to the exact line of code that caused the panic, which--combined with the panic message itself--is normally enough for a developer to quickly figure out the cause of the issue.</p> <p>As a user, this information can help work around the problem in a pinch, since it should hopefully point to the area of the code base in which the crash is happening.</p><div class="_attribution">
