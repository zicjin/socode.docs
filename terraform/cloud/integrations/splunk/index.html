Audit logs from Terraform Cloud are regularly pulled into Splunk, immediately giving visibility into key platform events within the predefined dashboards. Identify the most active policies, significant changes in resource operations, or filter actions by specific users within your organization. The app can be used with Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise.</p> <h2 id="prerequisites">  Prerequisites </h2> <p>Access and support for the Terraform Cloud for Splunk app is limited to customers in the Terraform Cloud Business tier.</p> <h3 id="splunk-cloud">  Splunk Cloud </h3> <p>There are no special prerequisites for Splunk Cloud users.</p> <h3 id="splunk-enterprise">  Splunk Enterprise </h3> <h4 id="networking-requirements">  Networking Requirements </h4> <p>In order for the Terraform Cloud for Splunk app to function properly, it must be able to make outbound requests over HTTPS (TCP port 443) to the Terraform Cloud application APIs. This may require perimeter networking as well as container host networking changes, depending on your environment. The IP ranges are documented in the <a href="../../architectural-details/ip-ranges">Terraform Cloud IP Ranges documentation</a>. The services which run on these IP ranges are described in the table below.</p> <table>
