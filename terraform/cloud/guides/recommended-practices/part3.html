 <h1 id="part-3-how-to-evolve-your-provisioning-practices">  Part 3: How to Evolve Your Provisioning Practices </h1> <p>This section describes the steps necessary to move an organization from manual provisioning processes to a collaborative infrastructure as code workflow. For each stage of operational maturity, we give instructions for moving your organization to the next stage, eventually arriving at our recommended workflow.</p> <p>We've split this section into multiple pages, so you can skip instructions that you've already implemented. Look back at your notes from Part 2, and start with the page about your current level of operational maturity.</p> <ul> <li>
