 <h1 id="part-3-1-how-to-move-from-manual-changes-to-semi-automation">  Part 3.1: How to Move from Manual Changes to Semi-Automation </h1> <p>Building infrastructure manually (with CLI or GUI tools) results in infrastructure that is hard to audit, hard to reproduce, hard to scale, and hard to share knowledge about.</p> <p>If your current provisioning practices are largely manual, your first goal is to begin using open source Terraform in a small, manageable subset of your infrastructure. Once you’ve gotten some small success using Terraform, you’ll have reached the semi-automated stage of provisioning maturity, and can begin to scale up and expand your Terraform usage.</p> <p>Allow one individual (or a small group) in your engineering team to get familiar with Terraform by following these steps:</p> <h2 id="1-install-terraform">  1.

Implement a Real Infrastructure Project </h2> <p>Choose a small real-life project and implement it with Terraform. Look at your organization’s list of upcoming projects, and designate one to be a Terraform proof-of-concept. Alternately, you can choose some existing infrastructure to re-implement with Terraform.</p> <p>The key is to choose a project with limited scope and clear boundaries, such as provisioning infrastructure for a new application on AWS. This helps keep your team from getting overwhelmed with features and possibilities. You can also look at some <a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/tree/master/examples">example AWS projects</a> to get a feel for your options. (The <a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/tree/master/examples/two-tier">AWS two-tier example</a> is often a good start.)</p> <p>Your goal here is to build a small but reliable core of expertise with Terraform, and demonstrate its benefits to others in the organization.</p> <h2 id="next">  Next </h2> <p>At this point, you’ve reached a semi-automated stage of provisioning practices — one or more people in the organization can write Terraform code to provision and modify resources, and a small but meaningful subset of your infrastructure is being managed as code. This is a good time to provide a small demo to the rest of team to show how easy it is to write and provision infrastructure with Terraform.</p> <p>Next, it's time to transition to a more complete infrastructure as code workflow.
