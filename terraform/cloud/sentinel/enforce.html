If the plan fails, the policy check will not be performed. The policy check uses the generated tfplan file, <a href="import/tfplan#value-applied">simulated apply object</a>, state and configuration to verify the rules in each of the policies.</p> <p>Enforcement level details can be found in the <a href="manage-policies">Managing Policies</a> documentation.</p> <p>All <code>hard mandatory</code> and <code>soft mandatory</code> policies must pass in order for the run to continue to the "Confirm &amp; Apply" state.</p> <p>If a <code>soft mandatory</code> policy fails, users with permission to override policies will be presented with an "Override &amp; Continue" button in the run. They have the ability to override the failed check and continue the execution of the run. This will not have any impact on future runs. (<a href="../users-teams-organizations/permissions">More about permissions.</a>)</p> <p>If an <code>advisory</code> fails, it will show the warning state in the run; however, the execution of the run will continue to the "Confirm &amp; Apply" state. No user action is required to override or continue the run execution.</p><div class="_attribution">
