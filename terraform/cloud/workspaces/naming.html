 <h1 id="workspace-naming">  Workspace Naming </h1> <p>Terraform Cloud organizes workspaces by name, so it's important to use a consistent and informative naming strategy. And although future releases of Terraform Cloud will add more organizational tools, the name will always be the most important piece of information about a workspace.</p> <p>Workspace names need to be 90 characters or less and can only include letters, numbers, <code>-</code>, and <code>_</code>.</p> <p>The best way to make names that are both unique and useful is to combine the workspace's most distinguishing <em>attributes</em> in a consistent order. Attributes can be any defining characteristic of a workspace â€” such as the component being managed, the environment it runs in, and the region it is provisioned into.</p> <p>A good strategy to start with is <code>&lt;COMPONENT&gt;-&lt;ENVIRONMENT&gt;-&lt;REGION&gt;</code>. For example:</p> <ul> <li>networking-prod-us-east </li> <li>networking-staging-us-east </li> <li>networking-prod-eu-central </li> <li>networking-staging-eu-central </li> <li>monitoring-prod-us-east </li> <li>monitoring-staging-us-east </li> <li>monitoring-prod-us-eu-central </li> <li>monitoring-staging-eu-central </li> </ul> <p>If those three attributes can't uniquely distinguish all of your workspaces, you might need to add another attribute; for example, the infrastructure provider (AWS, GCP, Azure), datacenter, or line of business.</p><div class="_attribution">
