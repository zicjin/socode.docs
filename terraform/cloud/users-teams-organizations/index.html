 <h1 id="users-teams-and-organizations">  Users, Teams, and Organizations </h1> <p>Terraform Cloud's organizational and access control model is based on three units: users, teams, and organizations.</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="users">Users</a> are individual members of an organization. They belong to teams, which are granted permissions on an organizationâ€™s workspaces. </li> <li>
<a href="teams">Teams</a> are groups of users that reflect your company's organizational structure. Organization owners can create teams and manage their membership. </li> <li>
<a href="organizations">Organizations</a> are shared spaces for teams to collaborate on workspaces. An organization can have many teams, and the owners of the organization set which teams have which permissions on which workspaces. </li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
