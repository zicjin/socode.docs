 <h1 id="cli-configuration">  CLI Configuration </h1> <p>Terraform CLI can be configured with some global settings, which are separate from any Terraform configuration and which apply across all working directories.</p> <p>We've designed Terraform such that an average user running Terraform CLI interactively will not need to interact with any of these settings. As a result, most of the global settings relate to advanced or automated workflows, or unusual environmental conditions like running Terraform on an airgapped instance.</p> <ul> <li>The <a href="config-file">CLI config file</a> configures provider installation and security features. </li> <li>Several <a href="environment-variables">environment variables</a> can configure Terraform's inputs and outputs; this includes some alternate ways to provide information that is usually passed on the command line or read from the state of the shell. </li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
