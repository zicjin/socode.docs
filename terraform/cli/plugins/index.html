 <h1 id="managing-plugins">  Managing Plugins </h1> <p>Terraform relies on plugins called "providers" in order to manage various types of resources. (For more information about providers, see <a href="../../language/providers/index">Providers</a> in the Terraform language docs.)</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Providers are currently the only plugin type most Terraform users will interact with. Terraform also supports third-party provisioner plugins, but we discourage their use.</p> </blockquote> <p>Terraform downloads and/or installs any providers <a href="../../language/providers/requirements">required</a> by a configuration when <a href="../init/index">initializing</a> a working directory. By default, this works without any additional interaction but requires network access to download providers from their source registry.</p> <p>You can configure Terraform's provider installation behavior to limit or skip network access, and to enable use of providers that aren't available via a networked source. Terraform also includes some commands to show information about providers and to reduce the effort of installing providers in airgapped environments.</p> <h2 id="configuring-plugin-installation">  Configuring Plugin Installation </h2> <p>Terraform's configuration file includes options for caching downloaded plugins, or explicitly specifying a local or HTTPS mirror to install plugins from. For more information, see <a href="../config/config-file">CLI Config File</a>.</p> <h2 id="getting-plugin-information">  Getting Plugin Information </h2> <p>Use the <a href="../commands/providers"><code>terraform providers</code></a> command to get information about the providers required by the current working directory's configuration.</p> <p>Use the <a href="../commands/version"><code>terraform version</code></a> command (or <code>terraform -version</code>) to show the specific provider versions installed for the current working directory.</p> <p>Use the <a href="../commands/providers/schema"><code>terraform providers schema</code></a> command to get machine-readable information about the resources and configuration options offered by each provider.</p> <h2 id="managing-plugin-installation">  Managing Plugin Installation </h2> <p>Use the <a href="../commands/providers/mirror"><code>terraform providers mirror</code></a> command to download local copies of every provider required by the current working directory's configuration. This directory will use the nested directory layout that Terraform expects when installing plugins from a local source, so you can transfer it directly to an airgapped system that runs Terraform.</p> <p>Use the <a href="../commands/providers/lock"><code>terraform providers lock</code></a> command to update the lock file that Terraform uses to ensure predictable runs when using ambiguous provider version constraints.</p><div class="_attribution">
