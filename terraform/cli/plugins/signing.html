  <h1 id="plugin-signing">  Plugin Signing </h1> <blockquote class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <p><strong>Note</strong> Currently only provider plugins fetched from a registry are authenticated.</p> </blockquote> <p>Terraform providers installed from the Registry are cryptographically signed, and the signature is verified at time of installation. There are three types of provider signatures, each with different trust implications:</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>Signed by HashiCorp</strong> - are built, signed, and supported by HashiCorp. </li> <li>
<strong>Signed by Trusted Partners</strong> - are built, signed, and supported by a third party. HashiCorp has verified the ownership of the private key and we provide a chain of trust to the CLI to verify this programatically. </li> <li>
<strong>Self-signed</strong> - are built, signed, and supported by a third party. HashiCorp does not provide a verification or chain of trust for the signature. You may obtain and validate fingerprints manually if you want to ensure you are using a binary you can trust. </li> </ul> <p>Terraform does <strong>NOT</strong> support fetching and using unsigned binaries, but you can manually install unsigned binaries. You should take extreme care when doing so as no programatic authentication is performed.</p> <p>Usage of plugins from the registry is subject to the Registry's <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
