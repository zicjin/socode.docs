 <h1 id="moving-resources">  Moving Resources </h1> <p>Terraform's state associates each real-world object with a configured resource at a specific <a href="resource-addressing">resource address</a>. This is seamless when changing a resource's attributes, but Terraform will lose track of a resource if you change its name, move it to a different module, or change its provider.</p> <p>Usually that's fine: Terraform will destroy the old resource, replace it with a new one (using the new resource address), and update any resources that rely on its attributes.</p> <p>In cases where it's important to preserve an existing infrastructure object, you can explicitly tell Terraform to associate it with a different configured resource.</p> <ul> <li>
<p><a href="../commands/state/mv">The <code>terraform state mv</code> command</a> changes which resource address in your configuration is associated with a particular real-world object. Use this to preserve an object when renaming a resource, or when moving a resource into or out of a child module.</p> </li> <li>
<p><a href="../commands/state/rm">The <code>terraform state rm</code> command</a> tells Terraform to stop managing a resource as part of the current working directory and workspace, <em>without</em> destroying the corresponding real-world object. (You can later use <code>terraform import</code> to start managing that resource in a different workspace or a different Terraform configuration.)</p> </li> <li>
<p><a href="../commands/state/replace-provider">The <code>terraform state replace-provider</code> command</a> transfers existing resources to a new provider without requiring them to be re-created.</p> </li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
