 <h1 id="forcing-re-creation-of-resources-tainting-">  Forcing Re-creation of Resources (Tainting) </h1> <p>When a resource declaration is modified, Terraform usually attempts to update the existing resource in place (although some changes can require destruction and re-creation, usually due to upstream API limitations).</p> <p>In some cases, you might want a resource to be destroyed and re-created even when Terraform doesn't think it's necessary. This is usually for objects that aren't fully described by their resource arguments due to side-effects that happen during creation; for example, a virtual machine that configures itself with <code>cloud-init</code> on startup might no longer meet your needs if the cloud-init configuration changes.</p> <ul> <li>
<p><a href="../commands/taint">The <code>terraform taint</code> command</a> tells Terraform to destroy and re-create a particular resource during the next apply, regardless of whether its resource arguments would normally require that.</p> </li> <li>
<p><a href="../commands/untaint">The <code>terraform untaint</code> command</a> undoes a previous taint, or can preserve a resource that was automatically tainted due to failed <a href="../../language/resources/provisioners/syntax">provisioners</a>.</p> </li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
