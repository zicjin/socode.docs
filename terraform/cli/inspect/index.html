 <h1 id="inspecting-infrastructure">  Inspecting Infrastructure </h1> <p>Terraform configurations and state data include some highly structured information about the resources they manage; this includes dependency information, outputs (which are pieces of generated or discovered data that the configuration's author considers important enough to surface to users), and more.</p> <p>Terraform CLI includes some commands for inspecting or transforming this data. You can use these to integrate other tools with Terraform's infrastructure data, or just to gain a deeper or more holistic understanding of your infrastructure.</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="../commands/graph">The <code>terraform graph</code> command</a> creates a visual representation of a configuration or a set of planned changes. </li> <li>
<a href="../commands/output">The <code>terraform output</code> command</a> can get the values for the top-level <a href="../../language/values/outputs">output values</a> of a configuration, which are often helpful when making use of the infrastructure Terraform has provisioned. </li> <li>
<a href="../commands/show">The <code>terraform show</code> command</a> can generate human-readable versions of a state file or plan file, or generate machine-readable versions that can be integrated with other tools. </li> <li>
<a href="../commands/state/list">The <code>terraform state list</code> command</a> can list the resources being managed by the current working directory and workspace, providing a complete or filtered list. </li> <li>
<a href="../commands/state/show">The <code>terraform state show</code> command</a> can print all of the attributes of a given resource being managed by the current working directory and workspace, including generated read-only attributes like the unique ID assigned by the cloud provider. </li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
