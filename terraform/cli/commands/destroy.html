 <h1 id="command-destroy">  Command: destroy </h1> <p>The <code>terraform destroy</code> command is a convenient way to destroy all remote objects managed by a particular Terraform configuration.</p> <p>While you will typically not want to destroy long-lived objects in a production environment, Terraform is sometimes used to manage ephemeral infrastructure for development purposes, in which case you can use <code>terraform destroy</code> to conveniently clean up all of those temporary objects once you are finished with your work.</p> <h2 id="usage">  Usage </h2> <p>Usage: <code>terraform destroy [options]</code></p> <p>This command is just a convenience alias for the following command:</p> <pre>terraform apply -destroy
</pre>
<p>For that reason, this command accepts most of the options that <a href="apply"><code>terraform apply</code></a> accepts, although it does not accept a plan file argument and forces the selection of the "destroy" planning mode.</p> <p>You can also create a speculative destroy plan, to see what the effect of destroying would be, by running the following command:</p> <pre>terraform plan -destroy
</pre>
<p>This will run <a href="plan"><code>terraform plan</code></a> in <em>destroy</em> mode, showing you the proposed destroy changes without executing them.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>-destroy</code> option to <code>terraform apply</code> exists only in Terraform v0.15.2 and later. For earlier versions, you <em>must</em> use <code>terraform destroy</code> to get the effect of <code>terraform apply -destroy</code>.</p> </blockquote><div class="_attribution">
