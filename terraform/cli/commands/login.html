 <h1 id="command-login">  Command: login </h1> <p>The <code>terraform login</code> command can be used to automatically obtain and save an API token for Terraform Cloud, Terraform Enterprise, or any other host that offers Terraform services.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This command is suitable only for use in interactive scenarios where it is possible to launch a web browser on the same host where Terraform is running. If you are running Terraform in an unattended automation scenario, you can <a href="../config/config-file#credentials">configure credentials manually in the CLI configuration</a>.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="usage">  Usage </h2> <p>Usage: <code>terraform login [hostname]</code></p> <p>If you don't provide an explicit hostname, Terraform will assume you want to log in to Terraform Cloud at <code>app.terraform.io</code>.</p> <h2 id="credentials-storage">  Credentials Storage </h2> <p>By default, Terraform will obtain an API token and save it in plain text in a local CLI configuration file called <code>credentials.tfrc.json</code>. When you run <code>terraform login</code>, it will explain specifically where it intends to save the API token and give you a chance to cancel if the current configuration is not as desired.</p> <p>If you don't wish to store your API token in the default location, you can optionally configure a <a href="../config/config-file#credentials-helpers">credentials helper program</a> which knows how to store and later retrieve credentials in some other system, such as your organization's existing secrets management system.</p> <h2 id="login-server-support">  Login Server Support </h2> <p>The <code>terraform login</code> command works with any server supporting the <a href="../../internals/login-protocol">login protocol</a>, including Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise.</p><div class="_attribution">
