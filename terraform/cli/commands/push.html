 <h1 id="command-push">  Command: push </h1> <blockquote class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"> <p><strong>Important:</strong> The <code>terraform push</code> command is no longer functional. Its functionality was replaced and surpassed by <a href="../../language/settings/backends/remote">the <code>remote</code> backend</a>, which works with current versions of Terraform Cloud. The <code>remote</code> backend allows you to run remote operations directly from the command line, and displays real-time output from the remote run environment.</p> </blockquote> <p>The <code>terraform push</code> command was an early implementation of remote Terraform runs. It allowed teams to push a configuration to a remote run environment in a discontinued version of Terraform Enterprise.</p> <p>The legacy Terraform Enterprise version that supported <code>terraform push</code> is no longer available, and there are no remaining instances of that version in operation. Without a service to push to, the command is now completely non-functional.</p><div class="_attribution">
