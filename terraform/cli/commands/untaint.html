 <h1 id="command-untaint">  Command: untaint </h1> <p>Terraform has a marker called "tainted" which it uses to track that an object might be damaged and so a future Terraform plan ought to replace it.</p> <p>Terraform automatically marks an object as "tainted" if an error occurs during a multi-step "create" action, because Terraform can't be sure that the object was left in a fully-functional state.</p> <p>You can also manually mark an object as "tainted" using the deprecated command <a href="taint"><code>terraform taint</code></a>, although we no longer recommend that workflow.</p> <p>If Terraform currently considers a particular object as tainted but you've determined that it's actually functioning correctly and need <em>not</em> be replaced, you can use <code>terraform untaint</code> to remove the taint marker from that object.</p> <p>This command <em>will not</em> modify any real remote objects, but will modify the state in order to remove the tainted status.</p> <p>If you remove the taint marker from an object but then later discover that it was degraded after all, you can create and apply a plan to replace it without first re-tainting the object, by using a command like the following:</p> <pre>terraform apply -replace="aws_instance.example[0]"
</pre>
<h2 id="usage">  Usage </h2> <p>Usage: <code>terraform untaint [options] address</code></p> <p>The <code>address</code> argument is a <a href="../state/resource-addressing">resource address</a> identifying a particular resource instance which is currently tainted.</p> <p>This command also accepts the following options:</p> <ul> <li>
<p><a href="#allow-missing"><code>-allow-missing</code></a> - If specified, the command will succeed (exit code 0) even if the resource is missing. The command might still return an error for other situations, such as if there is a problem reading or writing the state.</p> </li> <li>
<p><a href="#lock-false"><code>-lock=false</code></a> - Don't hold a state lock during the operation. This is dangerous if others might concurrently run commands against the same workspace.</p> </li> <li>
<p><a href="#lock-timeout-duration"><code>-lock-timeout=DURATION</code></a> - Unless locking is disabled with <code>-lock=false</code>, instructs Terraform to retry acquiring a lock for a period of time before returning an error. The duration syntax is a number followed by a time unit letter, such as "3s" for three seconds.</p> </li> <li>
<p><a href="#no-color"><code>-no-color</code></a> - Disables terminal formatting sequences in the output. Use this if you are running Terraform in a context where its output will be rendered by a system that cannot interpret terminal formatting.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For configurations using <a href="../../language/settings/backends/remote">the <code>remote</code> backend</a> only, <code>terraform untaint</code> also accepts the option <a href="../../language/settings/backends/remote#command-line-arguments"><code>-ignore-remote-version</code></a>.</p> <p>For configurations using <a href="../../language/settings/backends/local">the <code>local</code> backend</a> only, <code>terraform untaint</code> also accepts the legacy options <a href="../../language/settings/backends/local#command-line-arguments"><code>-state</code>, <code>-state-out</code>, and <code>-backup</code></a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
