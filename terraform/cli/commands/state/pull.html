 <h1 id="command-state-pull">  Command: state pull </h1> <p>The <code>terraform state pull</code> command is used to manually download and output the state from <a href="../../../language/state/remote">remote state</a>. This command also works with local state.</p> <h2 id="usage">  Usage </h2> <p>Usage: <code>terraform state pull</code></p> <p>This command will download the state from its current location, upgrade the local copy to the latest state file version that is compatible with locally-installed Terraform, and output the raw format to stdout.</p> <p>This is useful for reading values out of state (potentially pairing this command with something like <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>). It is also useful if you need to make manual modifications to state.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <p>Note: This command cannot be used to inspect the Terraform version of the remote state, as it will always be converted to the current Terraform version before output.</p> </blockquote><div class="_attribution">
