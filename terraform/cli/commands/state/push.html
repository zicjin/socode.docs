 <h1 id="command-state-push">  Command: state push </h1> <p>The <code>terraform state push</code> command is used to manually upload a local state file to <a href="../../../language/state/remote">remote state</a>. This command also works with local state.</p> <p>This command should rarely be used. It is meant only as a utility in case manual intervention is necessary with the remote state.</p> <h2 id="usage">  Usage </h2> <p>Usage: <code>terraform state push [options] PATH</code></p> <p>This command will push the state specified by PATH to the currently configured <a href="../../../language/settings/backends/index">backend</a>.</p> <p>If PATH is "-" then the state data to push is read from stdin. This data is loaded completely into memory and verified prior to being written to the destination state.</p> <p>Terraform will perform a number of safety checks to prevent you from making changes that appear to be unsafe:</p> <ul> <li>
<p><strong>Differing lineage</strong>: If the "lineage" value in the state differs, Terraform will not allow you to push the state. A differing lineage suggests that the states are completely different and you may lose data.</p> </li> <li>
<p><strong>Higher remote serial</strong>: If the "serial" value in the destination state is higher than the state being pushed, Terraform will prevent the push. A higher serial suggests that data is in the destination state that isn't accounted for in the local state being pushed.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Both of these safety checks can be disabled with the <code>-force</code> flag. <strong>This is not recommended.</strong> If you disable the safety checks and are pushing state, the destination state will be overwritten.</p> <p>For configurations using <a href="../../../language/settings/backends/remote">the <code>remote</code> backend</a> only, <code>terraform state push</code> also accepts the option <a href="../../../language/settings/backends/remote#command-line-arguments"><code>-ignore-remote-version</code></a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
