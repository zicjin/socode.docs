Each resource block describes one or more infrastructure objects, such as virtual networks, compute instances, or higher-level components such as DNS records.</p> <h2 id="resource-syntax">  Resource Syntax </h2> <p>Resource declarations can include a number of advanced features, but only a small subset are required for initial use. More advanced syntax features, such as single resource declarations that produce multiple similar remote objects, are described later in this page.</p> <pre data-language="ruby">resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-a1b2c3d4"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
</pre>
<p>A <code>resource</code> block declares a resource of a given type ("aws_instance") with a given local name ("web"). The name is used to refer to this resource from elsewhere in the same Terraform module, but has no significance outside that module's scope.</p> <p>The resource type and name together serve as an identifier for a given resource and so must be unique within a module.</p> <p>Within the block body (between <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>) are the configuration arguments for the resource itself. Most arguments in this section depend on the resource type, and indeed in this example both <code>ami</code> and <code>instance_type</code> are arguments defined specifically for <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/instance">the <code>aws_instance</code> resource type</a>.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Resource names must start with a letter or underscore, and may contain only letters, digits, underscores, and dashes.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="resource-types">  Resource Types </h2> <p>Each resource is associated with a single <em>resource type</em>, which determines the kind of infrastructure object it manages and what arguments and other attributes the resource supports.</p> <h3 id="providers">  Providers </h3> <p>Each resource type is implemented by a <a href="../providers/requirements">provider</a>, which is a plugin for Terraform that offers a collection of resource types. A provider usually provides resources to manage a single cloud or on-premises infrastructure platform. Providers are distributed separately from Terraform itself, but Terraform can automatically install most providers when initializing a working directory.</p> <p>In order to manage resources, a Terraform module must specify which providers it requires. Additionally, most providers need some configuration in order to access their remote APIs, and the root module must provide that configuration.</p> <p>For more information, see:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="../providers/requirements">Provider Requirements</a>, for declaring which providers a module uses. </li> <li>
<a href="../providers/configuration">Provider Configuration</a>, for configuring provider settings. </li> </ul> <p>Terraform usually automatically determines which provider to use based on a resource type's name. (By convention, resource type names start with their provider's preferred local name.) When using multiple configurations of a provider (or non-preferred local provider names), you must use the <code>provider</code> meta-argument to manually choose an alternate provider configuration. See <a href="../meta-arguments/resource-provider">the <code>provider</code> meta-argument</a> for more details.</p> <h3 id="resource-arguments">  Resource Arguments </h3> <p>Most of the arguments within the body of a <code>resource</code> block are specific to the selected resource type. The resource type's documentation lists which arguments are available and how their values should be formatted.</p> <p>The values for resource arguments can make full use of <a href="../expressions/index">expressions</a> and other dynamic Terraform language features.</p> <p>There are also some <em>meta-arguments</em> that are defined by Terraform itself and apply across all resource types. (See <a href="#meta-arguments">Meta-Arguments</a> below.)</p> <h3 id="documentation-for-resource-types">  Documentation for Resource Types </h3> <p>Every Terraform provider has its own documentation, describing its resource types and their arguments.</p> <p>Most publicly available providers are distributed on the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers">Terraform Registry</a>, which also hosts their documentation. When viewing a provider's page on the Terraform Registry, you can click the "Documentation" link in the header to browse its documentation. Provider documentation on the registry is versioned, and you can use the dropdown version menu in the header to switch which version's documentation you are viewing.</p> <p>To browse the publicly available providers and their documentation, see <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers">the providers section of the Terraform Registry</a>.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Provider documentation used to be hosted directly on terraform.io, as part of Terraform's core documentation. Although some provider documentation might still be hosted here, the Terraform Registry is now the main home for all public provider docs.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="resource-behavior">  Resource Behavior </h2> <p>For more information about how Terraform manages resources when applying a configuration, see <a href="behavior">Resource Behavior</a>.</p> <h2 id="meta-arguments">  Meta-Arguments </h2> <p>The Terraform language defines several meta-arguments, which can be used with any resource type to change the behavior of resources.</p> <p>The following meta-arguments are documented on separate pages:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="../meta-arguments/depends_on"><code>depends_on</code>, for specifying hidden dependencies</a> </li> <li>
<a href="../meta-arguments/count"><code>count</code>, for creating multiple resource instances according to a count</a> </li> <li>
<a href="../meta-arguments/for_each"><code>for_each</code>, to create multiple instances according to a map, or set of strings</a> </li> <li>
<a href="../meta-arguments/resource-provider"><code>provider</code>, for selecting a non-default provider configuration</a> </li> <li>
<a href="../meta-arguments/lifecycle"><code>lifecycle</code>, for lifecycle customizations</a> </li> <li>
<a href="provisioners/index"><code>provisioner</code> and <code>connection</code>, for taking extra actions after resource creation</a> </li> </ul> <h2 id="operation-timeouts">  Operation Timeouts </h2> <p>Some resource types provide a special <code>timeouts</code> nested block argument that allows you to customize how long certain operations are allowed to take before being considered to have failed. For example, <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/db_instance"><code>aws_db_instance</code></a> allows configurable timeouts for <code>create</code>, <code>update</code> and <code>delete</code> operations.</p> <p>Timeouts are handled entirely by the resource type implementation in the provider, but resource types offering these features follow the convention of defining a child block called <code>timeouts</code> that has a nested argument named after each operation that has a configurable timeout value. Each of these arguments takes a string representation of a duration, such as <code>"60m"</code> for 60 minutes, <code>"10s"</code> for ten seconds, or <code>"2h"</code> for two hours.</p> <pre data-language="ruby">resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  # ...

  timeouts {
    create = "60m"
    delete = "2h"
  }
}
</pre>
<p>The set of configurable operations is chosen by each resource type. Most resource types do not support the <code>timeouts</code> block at all. Consult the documentation for each resource type to see which operations it offers for configuration, if any.</p><div class="_attribution">
