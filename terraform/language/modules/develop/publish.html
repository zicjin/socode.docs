 <h1 id="publishing-modules">  Publishing Modules </h1> <p>If you've built a module that you intend to be reused, we recommend <a href="../../../registry/modules/publish">publishing the module</a> on the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io">Terraform Registry</a>. This will version your module, generate documentation, and more.</p> <p>Published modules can be easily consumed by Terraform, and users can <a href="../syntax#version">constrain module versions</a> for safe and predictable updates. The following example shows how a caller might use a module from the Terraform Registry:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">module "consul" {
  source = "hashicorp/consul/aws"
}
</pre>
<p>If you do not wish to publish your modules in the public registry, you can instead use a <a href="../../../registry/private">private registry</a> to get the same benefits.</p> <h2 id="distribution-via-other-sources">  Distribution via other sources </h2> <p>Although the registry is the native mechanism for distributing re-usable modules, Terraform can also install modules from <a href="../sources">various other sources</a>. The alternative sources do not support the first-class versioning mechanism, but some sources have their own mechanisms for selecting particular VCS commits, etc.</p> <p>We recommend that modules distributed via other protocols still use the <a href="structure">standard module structure</a> so that they can be used in a similar way as a registry module or be published on the registry at a later time.</p><div class="_attribution">
