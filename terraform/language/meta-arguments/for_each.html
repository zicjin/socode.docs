However, sometimes you want to manage several similar objects (like a fixed pool of compute instances) without writing a separate block for each one. Terraform has two ways to do this: <a href="count"><code>count</code></a> and <code>for_each</code>.</p> <p>If a resource or module block includes a <code>for_each</code> argument whose value is a map or a set of strings, Terraform will create one instance for each member of that map or set.</p> <h2 id="basic-syntax">  Basic Syntax </h2> <p><code>for_each</code> is a meta-argument defined by the Terraform language. It can be used with modules and with every resource type.</p> <p>The <code>for_each</code> meta-argument accepts a map or a set of strings, and creates an instance for each item in that map or set. Each instance has a distinct infrastructure object associated with it, and each is separately created, updated, or destroyed when the configuration is applied.</p> <p>Map:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  for_each = {
    a_group = "eastus"
    another_group = "westus2"
  }
  name     = each.key
  location = each.value
}
</pre>
<p>Set of strings:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">resource "aws_iam_user" "the-accounts" {
  for_each = toset( ["Todd", "James", "Alice", "Dottie"] )
  name     = each.key
}
</pre>
<p>Child module:</p> <pre data-language="ruby"># my_buckets.tf
module "bucket" {
  for_each = toset(["assets", "media"])
  source   = "./publish_bucket"
  name     = "${each.key}_bucket"
}
</pre>
<pre data-language="ruby"># publish_bucket/bucket-and-cloudfront.tf
variable "name" {} # this is the input parameter of the module

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  # Because var.name includes each.key in the calling
  # module block, its value will be different for
  # each instance of this module.
  bucket = var.name

  # ...
}

resource "aws_iam_user" "deploy_user" {
  # ...
}
</pre>
<h2 id="the-each-object">  The <code>each</code> Object </h2> <p>In blocks where <code>for_each</code> is set, an additional <code>each</code> object is available in expressions, so you can modify the configuration of each instance. This object has two attributes:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="#each-key"><code>each.key</code></a> — The map key (or set member) corresponding to this instance. </li> <li>
<a href="#each-value"><code>each.value</code></a> — The map value corresponding to this instance. (If a set was provided, this is the same as <code>each.key</code>.) </li> </ul> <h2 id="limitations-on-values-used-in-for_each">  Limitations on values used in <code>for_each</code> </h2> <p>The keys of the map (or all the values in the case of a set of strings) must be <em>known values</em>, or you will get an error message that <code>for_each</code> has dependencies that cannot be determined before apply, and a <code>-target</code> may be needed.</p> <p><code>for_each</code> keys cannot be the result (or rely on the result of) of impure functions, including <code>uuid</code>, <code>bcrypt</code>, or <code>timestamp</code>, as their evaluation is deferred during the main evaluation step.</p> <p>Sensitive values, such as <a href="../values/variables#suppressing-values-in-cli-output">sensitive input variables</a>, <a href="../values/outputs#sensitive-suppressing-values-in-cli-output">sensitive outputs</a>, or <a href="../expressions/references#sensitive-resource-attributes">sensitive resource attributes</a> (if the <code>provider_sensitive_attrs</code> experiment is enabled), cannot be used as arguments to <code>for_each</code>. The value used in <code>for_each</code> is used to identify the resource instance and will always be disclosed in UI output, which is why sensitive values are not allowed. Attempts to use sensitive values as <code>for_each</code> arguments will result in an error.</p> <p>If you transform a value containing sensitive data into an argument to be used in <code>for_each</code>, be aware that <a href="../expressions/function-calls#using-sensitive-data-as-function-arguments">most functions in Terraform will return a sensitive result if given an argument with any sensitive content</a>. In many cases, you can achieve similar results to a function used for this purpose by using a <code>for</code> expression. For example, if you would like to call <code>keys(local.map)</code>, where <code>local.map</code> is an object with sensitive values (but non-sensitive keys), you can create a value to pass to <code>for_each</code> with <code>toset([for k,v in local.map : k])</code>.</p> <h2 id="using-expressions-in-for_each">  Using Expressions in <code>for_each</code> </h2> <p>The <code>for_each</code> meta-argument accepts map or set <a href="../expressions/index">expressions</a>. However, unlike most arguments, the <code>for_each</code> value must be known <em>before</em> Terraform performs any remote resource actions. This means <code>for_each</code> can't refer to any resource attributes that aren't known until after a configuration is applied (such as a unique ID generated by the remote API when an object is created).</p> <p>The <code>for_each</code> value must be a map or set with one element per desired resource instance. When providing a set, you must use an expression that explicitly returns a set value, like the <a href="../functions/toset"><code>toset</code></a> function; to prevent unwanted surprises during conversion, the <code>for_each</code> argument does not implicitly convert lists or tuples to sets. If you need to declare resource instances based on a nested data structure or combinations of elements from multiple data structures you can use Terraform expressions and functions to derive a suitable value. For example:</p> <ul> <li>Transform a multi-level nested structure into a flat list by <a href="../functions/flatten#flattening-nested-structures-for-for_each">using nested <code>for</code> expressions with the <code>flatten</code> function</a>. </li> <li>Produce an exhaustive list of combinations of elements from two or more collections by <a href="../functions/setproduct#finding-combinations-for-for_each">using the <code>setproduct</code> function inside a <code>for</code> expression</a>. </li> </ul> <h3 id="chaining-for_each-between-resources">  Chaining <code>for_each</code> Between Resources </h3> <p>Because a resource using <code>for_each</code> appears as a map of objects when used in expressions elsewhere, you can directly use one resource as the <code>for_each</code> of another in situations where there is a one-to-one relationship between two sets of objects.</p> <p>For example, in AWS an <code>aws_vpc</code> object is commonly associated with a number of other objects that provide additional services to that VPC, such as an "internet gateway". If you are declaring multiple VPC instances using <code>for_each</code> then you can chain that <code>for_each</code> into another resource to declare an internet gateway for each VPC:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">variable "vpcs" {
  type = map(object({
    cidr_block = string
  }))
}

resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
  # One VPC for each element of var.vpcs
  for_each = var.vpcs

  # each.value here is a value from var.vpcs
  cidr_block = each.value.cidr_block
}

resource "aws_internet_gateway" "example" {
  # One Internet Gateway per VPC
  for_each = aws_vpc.example

  # each.value here is a full aws_vpc object
  vpc_id = each.value.id
}

output "vpc_ids" {
  value = {
    for k, v in aws_vpc.example : k =&gt; v.id
  }

  # The VPCs aren't fully functional until their
  # internet gateways are running.
  depends_on = [aws_internet_gateway.example]
}
</pre>
<p>This chaining pattern explicitly and concisely declares the relationship between the internet gateway instances and the VPC instances, which tells Terraform to expect the instance keys for both to always change together, and typically also makes the configuration easier to understand for human maintainers.</p> <h2 id="referring-to-instances">  Referring to Instances </h2> <p>When <code>for_each</code> is set, Terraform distinguishes between the block itself and the multiple <em>resource or module instances</em> associated with it. Instances are identified by a map key (or set member) from the value provided to <code>for_each</code>.</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="#lt-type-gt-lt-name-gt-"><code>&lt;TYPE&gt;.&lt;NAME&gt;</code></a> or <code>module.&lt;NAME&gt;</code> (for example, <code>azurerm_resource_group.rg</code>) refers to the block. </li> <li>
<a href="#lt-type-gt-lt-name-gt-lt-key-gt-"><code>&lt;TYPE&gt;.&lt;NAME&gt;[&lt;KEY&gt;]</code></a> or <code>module.&lt;NAME&gt;[&lt;KEY&gt;]</code> (for example, <code>azurerm_resource_group.rg["a_group"]</code>, <code>azurerm_resource_group.rg["another_group"]</code>, etc.) refers to individual instances. </li> </ul> <p>This is different from resources and modules without <code>count</code> or <code>for_each</code>, which can be referenced without an index or key.</p> <p>Similarly, resources from child modules with multiple instances are prefixed with <code>module.&lt;NAME&gt;[&lt;KEY&gt;]</code> when displayed in plan output and elsewhere in the UI. For a module without <code>count</code> or <code>for_each</code>, the address will not contain the module index as the module's name suffices to reference the module.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Within nested <code>provisioner</code> or <code>connection</code> blocks, the special <code>self</code> object refers to the current <em>resource instance,</em> not the resource block as a whole.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="using-sets">  Using Sets </h2> <p>The Terraform language doesn't have a literal syntax for <a href="../expressions/type-constraints#collection-types">set values</a>, but you can use the <code>toset</code> function to explicitly convert a list of strings to a set:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">locals {
  subnet_ids = toset([
    "subnet-abcdef",
    "subnet-012345",
  ])
}

resource "aws_instance" "server" {
  for_each = local.subnet_ids

  ami           = "ami-a1b2c3d4"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = each.key # note: each.key and each.value are the same for a set

  tags = {
    Name = "Server ${each.key}"
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Conversion from list to set discards the ordering of the items in the list and removes any duplicate elements. <code>toset(["b", "a", "b"])</code> will produce a set containing only <code>"a"</code> and <code>"b"</code> in no particular order; the second <code>"b"</code> is discarded.</p> <p>If you are writing a module with an <a href="../values/variables">input variable</a> that will be used as a set of strings for <code>for_each</code>, you can set its type to <code>set(string)</code> to avoid the need for an explicit type conversion:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">variable "subnet_ids" {
  type = set(string)
}

resource "aws_instance" "server" {
  for_each = var.subnet_ids

  # (and the other arguments as above)
