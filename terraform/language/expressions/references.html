Each of these names is an expression that references the associated value; you can use them as standalone expressions, or combine them with other expressions to compute new values.</p> <h2 id="types-of-named-values">  Types of Named Values </h2> <p>The main kinds of named values available in Terraform are:</p> <ul> <li>Resources </li> <li>Input variables </li> <li>Local values </li> <li>Child module outputs </li> <li>Data sources </li> <li>Filesystem and workspace info </li> <li>Block-local values </li> </ul> <p>The sections below explain each kind of named value in detail.</p> <p>Although many of these names use dot-separated paths that resemble <a href="types#indices-and-attributes">attribute notation</a> for elements of object values, they are not implemented as real objects. This means you must use them exactly as written: you cannot use square-bracket notation to replace the dot-separated paths, and you cannot iterate over the "parent object" of a named entity; for example, you cannot use <code>aws_instance</code> in a <code>for</code> expression to iterate over every AWS instance resource.</p> <h3 id="resources">  Resources </h3> <p><code>&lt;RESOURCE TYPE&gt;.&lt;NAME&gt;</code> represents a <a href="../resources/index">managed resource</a> of the given type and name.</p> <p>The value of a resource reference can vary, depending on whether the resource uses <code>count</code> or <code>for_each</code>:</p> <ul> <li>If the resource doesn't use <code>count</code> or <code>for_each</code>, the reference's value is an object. The resource's attributes are elements of the object, and you can access them using <a href="types#indices-and-attributes">dot or square bracket notation</a>. </li> <li>If the resource has the <code>count</code> argument set, the reference's value is a <em>list</em> of objects representing its instances. </li> <li>If the resource has the <code>for_each</code> argument set, the reference's value is a <em>map</em> of objects representing its instances. </li> </ul> <p>Any named value that does not match another pattern listed below will be interpreted by Terraform as a reference to a managed resource.</p> <p>For more information about how to use resource references, see <a href="#references-to-resource-attributes">references to resource attributes</a> below.</p> <h3 id="input-variables">  Input Variables </h3> <p><code>var.&lt;NAME&gt;</code> is the value of the <a href="../values/variables">input variable</a> of the given name.</p> <p>If the variable has a type constraint (<code>type</code> argument) as part of its declaration, Terraform will automatically convert the caller's given value to conform to the type constraint.</p> <p>For that reason, you can safely assume that a reference using <code>var.</code> will always produce a value that conforms to the type constraint, even if the caller provided a value of a different type that was automatically converted.</p> <p>In particular, note that if you define a variable as being of an object type with particular attributes then only <em>those specific attributes</em> will be available in expressions elsewhere in the module, even if the caller actually passed in a value with additional attributes. You must define in the type constraint all of the attributes you intend to use elsewhere in your module.</p> <h3 id="local-values">  Local Values </h3> <p><code>local.&lt;NAME&gt;</code> is the value of the <a href="../values/locals">local value</a> of the given name.</p> <p>Local values can refer to other local values, even within the same <code>locals</code> block, as long as you don't introduce circular dependencies.</p> <h3 id="child-module-outputs">  Child Module Outputs </h3> <p><code>module.&lt;MODULE NAME&gt;</code> is an value representing the results of <a href="../modules/syntax">a <code>module</code> block</a>.</p> <p>If the corresponding <code>module</code> block does not have either <code>count</code> nor <code>for_each</code> set then the value will be an object with one attribute for each output value defined in the child module. To access one of the module's <a href="../values/outputs">output values</a>, use <code>module.&lt;MODULE NAME&gt;.&lt;OUTPUT NAME&gt;</code>.</p> <p>If the corresponding <code>module</code> uses <code>for_each</code> then the value will be a map of objects whose keys correspond with the keys in the <code>for_each</code> expression, and whose values are each objects with one attribute for each output value defined in the child module, each representing one module instance.</p> <p>If the corresponding module uses <code>count</code> then the result is similar to for <code>for_each</code> except that the value is a <em>list</em> with the requested number of elements, each one representing one module instance.</p> <h3 id="data-sources">  Data Sources </h3> <p><code>data.&lt;DATA TYPE&gt;.&lt;NAME&gt;</code> is an object representing a <a href="../data-sources/index">data resource</a> of the given data source type and name. If the resource has the <code>count</code> argument set, the value is a list of objects representing its instances. If the resource has the <code>for_each</code> argument set, the value is a map of objects representing its instances.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href="#references-to-resource-attributes">References to Resource Attributes</a>, which also applies to data resources aside from the addition of the <code>data.</code> prefix to mark the reference as for a data resource.</p> <h3 id="filesystem-and-workspace-info">  Filesystem and Workspace Info </h3> <ul> <li>
<a href="#path-module"><code>path.module</code></a> is the filesystem path of the module where the expression is placed. </li> <li>
<a href="#path-root"><code>path.root</code></a> is the filesystem path of the root module of the configuration. </li> <li>
<a href="#path-cwd"><code>path.cwd</code></a> is the filesystem path of the current working directory. In normal use of Terraform this is the same as <code>path.root</code>, but some advanced uses of Terraform run it from a directory other than the root module directory, causing these paths to be different. </li> <li>
<a href="#terraform-workspace"><code>terraform.workspace</code></a> is the name of the currently selected <a href="../state/workspaces">workspace</a>. </li> </ul> <p>Use the values in this section carefully, because they include information about the context in which a configuration is being applied and so may inadvertently hurt the portability or composability of a module.</p> <p>For example, if you use <code>path.cwd</code> directly to populate a path into a resource argument then later applying the same configuration from a different directory or on a different computer with a different directory structure will cause the provider to consider the change of path to be a change to be applied, even if the path still refers to the same file.</p> <p>Similarly, if you use any of these values as a form of namespacing in a shared module, such as using <code>terraform.workspace</code> as a prefix for globally-unique object names, it may not be possible to call your module more than once in the same configuration.</p> <p>Aside from <code>path.module</code>, we recommend using the values in this section only in the root module of your configuration. If you are writing a shared module which needs a prefix to help create unique names, define an input variable for your module and allow the calling module to define the prefix. The calling module can then use <code>terraform.workspace</code> to define it if appropriate, or some other value if not:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">module "example" {
  # ...

  name_prefix = "app-${terraform-workspace}"
}
</pre>
<h3 id="block-local-values">  Block-Local Values </h3> <p>Within the bodies of certain blocks, or in some other specific contexts, there are other named values available beyond the global values listed above. These local names are described in the documentation for the specific contexts where they appear. Some of most common local names are:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="#count-index"><code>count.index</code></a>, in resources that use <a href="../meta-arguments/count">the <code>count</code> meta-argument</a>. </li> <li>
<a href="#each-key"><code>each.key</code></a> / <code>each.value</code>, in resources that use <a href="../meta-arguments/for_each">the <code>for_each</code> meta-argument</a>. </li> <li>
<a href="#self"><code>self</code></a>, in <a href="../resources/provisioners/syntax">provisioner</a> and <a href="../resources/provisioners/connection">connection</a> blocks. </li> </ul> <blockquote class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Local names are often referred to as <em>variables</em> or <em>temporary variables</em> in their documentation. These are not <a href="../values/variables">input variables</a>; they are just arbitrary names that temporarily represent a value.</p> </blockquote> <p>The names in this section relate to top-level configuration blocks only. If you use <a href="dynamic-blocks"><code>dynamic</code> blocks</a> to dynamically generate resource-type-specific <em>nested</em> blocks within <code>resource</code> and <code>data</code> blocks then you'll refer to the key and value of each element differently. See the <code>dynamic</code> blocks documentation for details.</p> <h2 id="named-values-and-dependencies">  Named Values and Dependencies </h2> <p>Constructs like resources and module calls often use references to named values in their block bodies, and Terraform analyzes these expressions to automatically infer dependencies between objects. For example, an expression in a resource argument that refers to another managed resource creates an implicit dependency between the two resources.</p> <h2 id="references-to-resource-attributes">  References to Resource Attributes </h2> <p>The most common reference type is a reference to an attribute of a resource which has been declared either with a <code>resource</code> or <code>data</code> block. Because the contents of such blocks can be quite complicated themselves, expressions referring to these contents can also be complicated.</p> <p>Consider the following example resource block:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-abc123"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  ebs_block_device {
    device_name = "sda2"
    volume_size = 16
  }
  ebs_block_device {
    device_name = "sda3"
    volume_size = 20
  }
}
</pre>
<p>The documentation for <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/instance"><code>aws_instance</code></a> lists all of the arguments and nested blocks supported for this resource type, and also lists a number of attributes that are <em>exported</em> by this resource type. All of these different resource type schema constructs are available for use in references, as follows:</p> <ul> <li>The <code>ami</code> argument set in the configuration can be used elsewhere with the reference expression <code>aws_instance.example.ami</code>. </li> <li>The <code>id</code> attribute exported by this resource type can be read using the same syntax, giving <code>aws_instance.example.id</code>. </li> <li>The arguments of the <code>ebs_block_device</code> nested blocks can be accessed using a <a href="splat">splat expression</a>. For example, to obtain a list of all of the <code>device_name</code> values, use <code>aws_instance.example.ebs_block_device[*].device_name</code>. </li> <li>The nested blocks in this particular resource type do not have any exported attributes, but if <code>ebs_block_device</code> were to have a documented <code>id</code> attribute then a list of them could be accessed similarly as <code>aws_instance.example.ebs_block_device[*].id</code>. </li> <li>
<p>Sometimes nested blocks are defined as taking a logical key to identify each block, which serves a similar purpose as the resource's own name by providing a convenient way to refer to that single block in expressions. If <code>aws_instance</code> had a hypothetical nested block type <code>device</code> that accepted such a key, it would look like this in configuration:</p> <pre data-language="ruby">  device "foo" {
    size = 2
  }
  device "bar" {
    size = 4
  }
</pre>
<p>Arguments inside blocks with <em>keys</em> can be accessed using index syntax, such as <code>aws_instance.example.device["foo"].size</code>.</p> <p>To obtain a map of values of a particular argument for <em>labelled</em> nested block types, use a <a href="for"><code>for</code> expression</a>: <code>{for k, device in aws_instance.example.device : k =&gt; device.size}</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>When a resource has the <a href="../meta-arguments/count"><code>count</code></a> argument set, the resource itself becomes a <em>list</em> of instance objects rather than a single object. In that case, access the attributes of the instances using either <a href="splat">splat expressions</a> or index syntax:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="#aws_instance-example-id"><code>aws_instance.example[*].id</code></a> returns a list of all of the ids of each of the instances. </li> <li>
<a href="#aws_instance-example-0-id"><code>aws_instance.example[0].id</code></a> returns just the id of the first instance. </li> </ul> <p>When a resource has the <a href="../meta-arguments/for_each"><code>for_each</code></a> argument set, the resource itself becomes a <em>map</em> of instance objects rather than a single object, and attributes of instances must be specified by key, or can be accessed using a <a href="for"><code>for</code> expression</a>.</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="#aws_instance-example-quot-a-quot-id"><code>aws_instance.example["a"].id</code></a> returns the id of the "a"-keyed resource. </li> <li>
<a href="#for-value-in-aws_instance-example-value-id-"><code>[for value in aws_instance.example: value.id]</code></a> returns a list of all of the ids of each of the instances. </li> </ul> <p>Note that unlike <code>count</code>, splat expressions are <em>not</em> directly applicable to resources managed with <code>for_each</code>, as splat expressions must act on a list value. However, you can use the <code>values()</code> function to extract the instances as a list and use that list value in a splat expression:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="#values-aws_instance-example-id"><code>values(aws_instance.example)[*].id</code></a> </li> </ul> <h3 id="sensitive-resource-attributes">  Sensitive Resource Attributes </h3> <p>When defining the schema for a resource type, a provider developer can mark certain attributes as <em>sensitive</em>, in which case Terraform will show a placeholder marker <code>(sensitive)</code> instead of the actual value when rendering a plan involving that attribute.</p> <p>A provider attribute marked as sensitive behaves similarly to an <a href="../values/variables#suppressing-values-in-cli-output">an input variable declared as sensitive</a>, where Terraform will hide the value in the plan and apply messages and will also hide any other values you derive from it as sensitive. However, there are some limitations to that behavior as described in <a href="../values/variables#cases-where-terraform-may-disclose-a-sensitive-variable">Cases where Terraform may disclose a sensitive variable</a>.</p> <p>If you use a sensitive value from a resource attribute as part of an <a href="../values/outputs">output value</a> then Terraform will require you to also mark the output value itself as sensitive, to confirm that you intended to export it.</p> <p>Terraform will still record sensitive values in the <a href="../state/index">state</a>, and so anyone who can access the state data will have access to the sensitive values in cleartext. For more information, see <a href="../state/sensitive-data"><em>Sensitive Data in State</em></a>.</p> <blockquote class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Treating values derived from a sensitive resource attribute as sensitive themselves was introduced in Terraform v0.15. Earlier versions of Terraform will obscure the direct value of a sensitive resource attribute, but will <em>not</em> automatically obscure other values derived from sensitive resource attributes.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="values-not-yet-known">  Values Not Yet Known </h3> <p>When Terraform is planning a set of changes that will apply your configuration, some resource attribute values cannot be populated immediately because their values are decided dynamically by the remote system. For example, if a particular remote object type is assigned a generated unique id on creation, Terraform cannot predict the value of this id until the object has been created.</p> <p>To allow expressions to still be evaluated during the plan phase, Terraform uses special "unknown value" placeholders for these results. In most cases you don't need to do anything special to deal with these, since the Terraform language automatically handles unknown values during expressions, so that for example adding a known value to an unknown value automatically produces an unknown value as the result.</p> <p>However, there are some situations where unknown values <em>do</em> have a significant effect:</p> <ul> <li>
<p>The <code>count</code> meta-argument for resources cannot be unknown, since it must be evaluated during the plan phase to determine how many instances are to be created.</p> </li> <li>
<p>If unknown values are used in the configuration of a data resource, that data resource cannot be read during the plan phase and so it will be deferred until the apply phase. In this case, the results of the data resource will <em>also</em> be unknown values.</p> </li> <li>
<p>If an unknown value is assigned to an argument inside a <code>module</code> block, any references to the corresponding input variable within the child module will use that unknown value.</p> </li> <li>
<p>If an unknown value is used in the <code>value</code> argument of an output value, any references to that output value in the parent module will use that unknown value.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Terraform will attempt to validate that unknown values are of suitable types where possible, but incorrect use of such values may not be detected until the apply phase, causing the apply to fail.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Unknown values appear in the <code>terraform plan</code> output as <code>(not yet known)</code>.</p><div class="_attribution">
