 <h1 id="publishing-to-the-registry">  Publishing to the Registry </h1> <p>Publishing providers built on the provider development framework to the Terraform Registry works the same as <a href="../../registry/providers/publishing">publishing providers built on SDKv2</a>, with a minor difference. Providers built on the framework are built on version 6 of the Terraform protocol. The Registry, by default, assumes providers being published support version 5 of the Terraform protocol, which providers built on the framework do not. The Registry needs to be told about this difference in protocol version support. This is done by adding a manifest to the provider's release assets.</p> <h2 id="add-a-version-manifest">  Add a Version Manifest </h2> <p>When uploading your new provider version to GitHub, next to the zip files containing your binaries for each platform, include a file named <code>terraform-provider-$NAME_$VERSION_manifest.json</code> (where <code>$NAME</code> is your provider's name, like <code>random</code> and <code>$VERSION</code> is your provider's version, like <code>1.2.3</code>) with the following contents:</p> <pre>{
  "version": 1,
  "metadata": {
    "protocol_versions": ["6.0"],
  },
}
</pre>
<p>Include the SHA-256 checksum of this JSON file in your <code>SHA256SUMS</code> file.</p> <p>The registry will detect this file and understand this version of your provider only supports version 6 of the Terraform protocol, and will correctly advertise that fact to Terraform, so Terraform versions that don't support protocol 6 will not download it.</p><div class="_attribution">
