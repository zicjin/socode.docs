        Return whether each value contains `pattern`.

        In this case, we are illustrating how to use sections, even
        if the example is simple enough and does not require them.

        Examples
        --------
        &gt;&gt;&gt; s = pd.Series('Antelope', 'Lion', 'Zebra', np.nan)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; s.contains(pattern='a')
        0    False
        1    False
        2     True
        3      NaN
        dtype: bool

        **Case sensitivity**

        With `case_sensitive` set to `False` we can match `a` with both
        `a` and `A`:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; s.contains(pattern='a', case_sensitive=False)
        0     True
        1    False
        2     True
        3      NaN
        dtype: bool

        **Missing values**

        We can fill missing values in the output using the `na` parameter:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; s.contains(pattern='a', na=False)
        0    False
        1    False
        2     True
        3    False
        dtype: bool

    A sample DataFrame method.

    Do not import numpy and pandas.

    Try to use meaningful data, when it makes the example easier
    to understand.

    Try to avoid positional arguments like in `df.method(1)`. They
    can be all right if previously defined with a meaningful name,
    like in `present_value(interest_rate)`, but avoid them otherwise.

    When presenting the behavior with different parameters, do not place
    all the calls one next to the other. Instead, add a short sentence
    explaining what the example shows.

    Examples
    --------

Here are some attention points:</p> <ul> <li>Import all needed libraries (except for pandas and numpy, those are already imported as <code>import pandas as pd</code> and <code>import numpy as np</code>) and define all variables you use in the example. </li> <li>
<p class="first">Try to avoid using random data. However random data might be OK in some cases, like if the function you are documenting deals with probability distributions, or if the amount of data needed to make the function result meaningful is too much, such that creating it manually is very cumbersome. In those cases, always use a fixed random seed to make the generated examples predictable. Example:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; np.random.seed(42)

This helps us keep docstrings consistent, while keeping things clear for the user reading. It comes at the cost of some complexity when writing.</p> <p>Each shared docstring will have a base template with variables, like <code>%(klass)s</code>. The variables filled in later on using the <code>Substitution</code> decorator. Finally, docstrings can be appended to with the <code>Appender</code> decorator.</p> <p>In this example, we’ll create a parent docstring normally (this is like <code>pandas.core.generic.NDFrame</code>. Then we’ll have two children (like <code>pandas.core.series.Series</code> and <code>pandas.core.frame.DataFrame</code>). We’ll substitute the children’s class names in this docstring.</p> <pre data-language="python">class Parent:
    def my_function(self):
        """Apply my function to %(klass)s."""
        ...


class ChildA(Parent):
    @Substitution(klass="ChildA")
    @Appender(Parent.my_function.__doc__)

class ChildB(Parent):
    @Substitution(klass="ChildB")

&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ChildA.my_function.__doc__)
Apply my function to ChildA.
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ChildB.my_function.__doc__)
Apply my function to ChildB.
</pre> <p>Notice two things:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>We “append” the parent docstring to the children docstrings, which are initially empty.</li> <li>Python decorators are applied inside out. So the order is Append then Substitution, even though Substitution comes first in the file.</li> </ol> <p>Our files will often contain a module-level <code>_shared_doc_kwargs</code> with some common substitution values (things like <code>klass</code>, <code>axes</code>, etc).</p> <p>You can substitute and append in one shot with something like</p> <pre data-language="python">@Appender(template % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def my_function(self):
    ...
</pre> <p>where <code>template</code> may come from a module-level <code>_shared_docs</code> dictionary mapping function names to docstrings. Wherever possible, we prefer using <code>Appender</code> and <code>Substitution</code>, since the docstring-writing processes is slightly closer to normal.</p> <p>See <code>pandas.core.generic.NDFrame.fillna</code> for an example template, and <code>pandas.core.series.Series.fillna</code> and <code>pandas.core.generic.frame.fillna</code> for the filled versions.</p><div class="_attribution">
