<h1 id="overview">Package overview</h1> <p id="package-overview"><strong>pandas</strong> is a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, <strong>real world</strong> data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming <strong>the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language</strong>. It is already well on its way toward this goal.</p> <p>pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:</p>  <ul class="simple"> <li>Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet</li> <li>Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.</li> <li>Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels</li> <li>Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure</li> </ul>  <p>The two primary data structures of pandas, <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/api/pandas.series#pandas.Series" title="pandas.Series"><code>Series</code></a> (1-dimensional) and <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/api/pandas.dataframe#pandas.DataFrame" title="pandas.DataFrame"><code>DataFrame</code></a> (2-dimensional), handle the vast majority of typical use cases in finance, statistics, social science, and many areas of engineering. For R users, <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/api/pandas.dataframe#pandas.DataFrame" title="pandas.DataFrame"><code>DataFrame</code></a> provides everything that R’s <code>data.frame</code> provides and much more. pandas is built on top of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.numpy.org">NumPy</a> and is intended to integrate well within a scientific computing environment with many other 3rd party libraries.</p> <p>Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:</p>  <ul class="simple"> <li>Easy handling of <strong>missing data</strong> (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data</li> <li>Size mutability: columns can be <strong>inserted and deleted</strong> from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects</li> <li>Automatic and explicit <strong>data alignment</strong>: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let <code>Series</code>, <code>DataFrame</code>, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations</li> <li>Powerful, flexible <strong>group by</strong> functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data</li> <li>Make it <strong>easy to convert</strong> ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects</li> <li>Intelligent label-based <strong>slicing</strong>, <strong>fancy indexing</strong>, and <strong>subsetting</strong> of large data sets</li> <li>Intuitive <strong>merging</strong> and <strong>joining</strong> data sets</li> <li>Flexible <strong>reshaping</strong> and pivoting of data sets</li> <li>
<strong>Hierarchical</strong> labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)</li> <li>Robust IO tools for loading data from <strong>flat files</strong> (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving / loading data from the ultrafast <strong>HDF5 format</strong>
</li> <li>
<strong>Time series</strong>-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting and lagging, etc.</li> </ul>  <p>Many of these principles are here to address the shortcomings frequently experienced using other languages / scientific research environments. For data scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages: munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas is the ideal tool for all of these tasks.</p> <p>Some other notes</p>  <ul class="simple"> <li>pandas is <strong>fast</strong>. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been extensively tweaked in <a class="reference external" href="https://cython.org">Cython</a> code. However, as with anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance. So if you focus on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster specialized tool.</li> <li>pandas is a dependency of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html">statsmodels</a>, making it an important part of the statistical computing ecosystem in Python.</li> <li>pandas has been used extensively in production in financial applications.</li> </ul>   <h2 id="data-structures">Data structures</h2> <table class="colwidths-given docutils">  <thead valign="bottom"> <tr>

For example, DataFrame is a container for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like fashion.</p> <p>Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions which take into account the typical orientation of time series and cross-sectional data sets. When using ndarrays to store 2- and 3-dimensional data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular data set there is likely to be a “right” way to orient the data. The goal, then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data transformations in downstream functions.</p> <p>For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to think of the <strong>index</strong> (the rows) and the <strong>columns</strong> rather than axis 0 and axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more readable code:</p> <pre data-language="python">for col in df.columns:
    series = df[col]
    # do something with series
</pre>    <h2 id="mutability-and-copying-of-data">Mutability and copying of data</h2> <p>All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However, the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data untouched. In general we like to <strong>favor immutability</strong> where sensible.</p>   <h2 id="getting-support">Getting support</h2> <p>The first stop for pandas issues and ideas is the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues">Github Issue Tracker</a>.
