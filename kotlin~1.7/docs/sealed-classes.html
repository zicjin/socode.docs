<h1 data-toc="sealed-classes" id="sealed-classes.md">Sealed classes</h1>
<p id="fcee0f79"><em id="bc9e40da" class="">Sealed</em> classes and interfaces represent restricted class hierarchies that provide more control over inheritance. All direct subclasses of a sealed class are known at compile time. No other subclasses may appear outside a module within which the sealed class is defined. For example, third-party clients can't extend your sealed class in their code. Thus, each instance of a sealed class has a type from a limited set that is known when this class is compiled.</p>
<p id="eec2d45e">The same works for sealed interfaces and their implementations: once a module with a sealed interface is compiled, no new implementations can appear.</p>
<p id="7ab49fa4">In some sense, sealed classes are similar to <a href="enum-classes" id="1e203c18"><code class="code ">enum</code></a> classes: the set of values for an enum type is also restricted, but each enum constant exists only as a <em id="c86ed2c1" class="">single instance</em>, whereas a subclass of a sealed class can have <em id="985e8f6f" class="">multiple</em> instances, each with its own state.</p>
<p id="7563a4c4">As an example, consider a library's API. It's likely to contain error classes to let the library users handle errors that it can throw. If the hierarchy of such error classes includes interfaces or abstract classes visible in the public API, then nothing prevents implementing or extending them in the client code. However, the library doesn't know about errors declared outside it, so it can't treat them consistently with its own classes. With a sealed hierarchy of error classes, library authors can be sure that they know all possible error types and no other ones can appear later.</p>
<p id="d4bfde46">To declare a sealed class or interface, put the <code class="code ">sealed</code> modifier before its name:</p>
<pre class="code" data-language="kotlin">sealed interface Error

sealed class IOError(): Error

class FileReadError(val file: File): IOError()
class DatabaseError(val source: DataSource): IOError()

object RuntimeError : Error
</pre>
<p id="5bad864">A sealed class is <a href="classes#abstract-classes" id="89b653a8">abstract</a> by itself, it cannot be instantiated directly and can have <code class="code ">abstract</code> members.</p>
<p id="10ace2b8">Constructors of sealed classes can have one of two <a href="visibility-modifiers" id="99ede57b">visibilities</a>: <code class="code ">protected</code> (by default) or <code class="code ">private</code>:</p>
<pre class="code" data-language="kotlin">sealed class IOError {
    constructor() { /*...*/ } // protected by default
    private constructor(description: String): this() { /*...*/ } // private is OK
    // public constructor(code: Int): this() {} // Error: public and internal are not allowed
}

<p id="50e71a0c">Direct subclasses of sealed classes and interfaces must be declared in the same package. They may be top-level or nested inside any number of other named classes, named interfaces, or named objects.

<p id="6c6dd504">There is one more inheritance restriction in <a href="multiplatform-get-started" id="21ab7c9f">multiplatform projects</a>: direct subclasses of sealed classes must reside in the same source set.

<p id="4980ec77">If a sealed class is declared as <code class="code ">expect</code> in a common source set and have <code class="code ">actual</code> implementations in platform source sets, both <code class="code ">expect</code> and <code class="code ">actual</code> versions can have subclasses in their source sets. Moreover, if you use a <a href="multiplatform-share-on-platforms#share-code-on-similar-platforms" id="b36ed35">hierarchical structure</a>, you can create subclasses in any source set between the <code class="code ">expect</code> and <code class="code ">actual</code> declarations.</p>

If it's possible to verify that the statement covers all cases, you don't need to add an <code class="code ">else</code> clause to the statement.
