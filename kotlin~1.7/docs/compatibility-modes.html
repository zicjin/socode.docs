<h1 data-toc="compatibility-modes" id="compatibility-modes.md">Compatibility modes</h1>
<p id="12c73170">When a big team is migrating onto a new version, it may appear in an "inconsistent state" at some point, when some developers have already updated, and others haven't. To prevent the former from writing and committing code that others may not be able to compile, we provide the following command line switches (also available in the IDE and <a href="gradle#compiler-options" id="303ca7b3">Gradle</a>/<a href="maven#specifying-compiler-options" id="11ac1f8c">Maven</a>):</p>
<ul class="list _ul" id="9ef3f850">
<li class="list__item" id="541b3976"><p><code class="code ">-language-version X.Y</code> - compatibility mode for Kotlin language version X.Y, reports errors for all language features that came out later.</p></li>
<li class="list__item" id="421f0262"><p><code class="code ">-api-version X.Y</code> - compatibility mode for Kotlin API version X.Y, reports errors for all code using newer APIs from the Kotlin Standard Library (including the code generated by the compiler).</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="b4265ab2">Currently, we support the development for three previous language and API versions in addition to the latest stable one.</p>
<p id="fce4d459"><em id="912edd94" class="">Below, we use OV for "Older Version", and NV for "Newer Version".</em></p>
<section class="chapter"><h2 id="binary-compatibility-warnings" data-toc="compatibility-modes#binary-compatibility-warnings">Binary compatibility warnings</h2>
<p id="c16e26d3">If you use the NV Kotlin compiler and have the OV standard library or the OV reflection library in the classpath, it can be a sign that the project is misconfigured. To prevent unexpected problems during compilation or at runtime, we suggest either updating the dependencies to NV, or specifying the API version / language version arguments explicitly. Otherwise, the compiler detects that something can go wrong and reports a warning.</p>
<p id="d10c9ac">For example, if OV = 1.0 and NV = 1.1, you can observe one of the following warnings:</p>
<ul class="list _ul" id="b87ddefe">
<li class="list__item" id="e183d534">
<p><code class="code ">Runtime JAR files in the classpath have the version 1.0, which is older than the API version 1.1. Consider using the runtime of version 1.1, or pass '-api-version 1.0' explicitly to restrict the available APIs to the runtime of version 1.0.</code></p>
<p id="752b6738">This means that you're using the Kotlin compiler 1.1 against the standard or reflection library of version 1.0. This can be handled in different ways:</p>
<ul class="list _ul" id="9ca8335d">
<li class="list__item" id="b64b7bc8"><p>If you intend to use the APIs from the 1.1 Standard Library, or language features that depend on those APIs, you should upgrade the dependency to the version 1.1.</p></li>
<li class="list__item" id="841a59e0"><p>If you want to keep your code compatible with the 1.0 standard library, you can pass <code class="code ">-api-version 1.0</code>.</p></li>
<li class="list__item" id="f7d4f8c"><p>If you've just upgraded to Kotlin 1.1 but can not use new language features yet (e.g. because some of your teammates may not have upgraded), you can pass <code class="code ">-language-version 1.0</code>, which will restrict all APIs and language features to 1.0.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="list__item" id="6feb2aae">
<p><code class="code ">Runtime JAR files in the classpath should have the same version. These files were found in the classpath: kotlin-reflect.jar (version 1.0) kotlin-stdlib.jar (version 1.1) Consider providing an explicit dependency on kotlin-reflect 1.1 to prevent strange errors Some runtime JAR files in the classpath have an incompatible version. Consider removing them from the classpath</code></p>
<p id="7d1bdd6">This means that you have a dependency on libraries of different versions, for example the 1.1 standard library and the 1.0 reflection library. To prevent subtle errors at runtime, we recommend you to use the same version of all Kotlin libraries. In this case, consider adding an explicit dependency on the 1.1 reflection library.</p>
</li>
<li class="list__item" id="296288e0">
<p><code class="code ">Some JAR files in the classpath have the Kotlin Runtime library bundled into them. This may cause difficult to debug problems if there's a different version of the Kotlin Runtime library in the classpath. Consider removing these libraries from the classpath</code></p>
<p id="6370b9be">This means that there's a library in the classpath which does not depend on the Kotlin standard library as a Gradle/Maven dependency, but is distributed in the same artifact with it (i.e. has it <em id="247e6252" class="">bundled</em>). Such a library may cause issues because standard build tools do not consider it an instance of the Kotlin standard library, thus it's not subject to the dependency version resolution mechanisms, and you can end up with several versions of the same library in the classpath. Consider contacting the authors of such a library and suggesting to use the Gradle/Maven dependency instead.</p>
