<p id="54d66fae">A Kotlin User Group, or KUG, is a community that is dedicated to Kotlin and that offers you a place to share your Kotlin programming experience with like-minded people.</p>
<p id="c8164cd1">To become an KUG, your community should have some specific features shared by every KUG. It should:</p>
<ul class="list _ul" id="aadf6592">
<li class="list__item" id="4bd5c5"><p>Provide Kotlin-related content, with regular meetups as the main form of activity.</p></li>
<li class="list__item" id="c0c23cf3"><p>Host regular events (at least once every 3 months) with open registration and without any restriction for attendance.</p></li>
<li class="list__item" id="932d0e84"><p>Be driven and organized by the community, and it should not use events to earn money or gain any other business benefits from members and attendees.</p></li>
<li class="list__item" id="f43a801"><p>Follow and ensure a code of conduct in order to provide a welcoming environment for attendees of any background and experience (check-out our recommended <a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+Open+Source+and+Community+Code+of+Conduct" id="852e346a" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code of Conduct</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="8fe30fce">There are no limits regarding the format for KUG meetups. They can take place in whatever fashion works best for the community, whether that includes presentations, hands-on labs, lectures, hackathons, or informal beer-driven get-togethers.</p>

<li class="list__item" id="62ba57c0"><p>Keep your user group active. Run meetups regularly, at least once every 3 months.</p></li>
<li class="list__item" id="9d068396"><p>Announce your KUG meetups at least 2 weeks in advance. The announcement should contain a list of talks and the names of the speakers, as well as the location, timing, and any other crucial info about the event.</p></li>
<li class="list__item" id="251d45c9"><p>KUG events should be free or, if you need to cover organizing expenses, limit prices to a maximum of 10 USD.</p></li>
<li class="list__item" id="c859b248"><p>Your group should have a code of conduct available for all members.</p></li>
